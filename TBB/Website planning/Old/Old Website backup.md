![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giancarnevale_None_4b0fcad4-70f5-4ae9-9625-c903eafb1ae0-2-1024x1024.png)

Bitcoin is one of the most amazing technological revolutions of our generation. Far to few understand its significance.

Like you, I ignored bitcoin for a very long time. I thought it was an investment or some kind of money…but bitcoin isn’t what it appears at first glance.

In fact, Bitcoin is, _by far,_ the most interesting thing I’ve ever learned about in my entire life.

And trust me — I’ve spent over a decade on the internet learning random things on the daily. Scouring obscure subreddits and diving deep into YouTube holes…and yet…nothing comes anywhere close to the beautiful complexity of bitcoin.

My entire purpose in this world is to be a bitcoin educator and consultant. I’ve firmly decided that I’m dedicating the rest of my life to this internet money project, and to help others achieve financial sovereignty.

My decision to focus my life on this project took years of research and internal debate, and I don’t take this lightly.

My ultimate goal is to inspire others to be curious about this extremely disruptive and revolutionary technology. Only if my inspiration causes you to learn more about bitcoin, will you understand why I’m doing this.

But…if you don’t believe me, or don’t get it yet, that’s ok! Trust me, I didn’t believe bitcoiners for a very long time either.

It might take 5-10 years of ignoring it and and multiple exposures before you realize.

All I want is for you to remember me as the bitcoin guy and to come to me with questions when you need bitcoin for yourself and your family.

## Ok so, the thing you should know about bitcoin is that it’s not about making money.

It’s not about getting rich, and it’s not about the price.

It’s about freedom. It’s about monetary revolution. It’s about global economic disruption.

Will fiat debasement and bitcoin adoption lead to increased purchasing power? Maybe.

What I want to get across is that bitcoin is a tool of self sovereignty and a check on tyrannical power.

If you’re only here for the gains you should probably leave and invest in something you understand.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giancarnevale_None_7f0cd79e-fb9d-40fe-9987-a7162a743a97-1024x1024.png)

## Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency for a reason.

It’s the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth. It’s the most secure and the most decentralized protocol in existence.

Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems, eliminating the need for trusting in third parties like banks, corporations, and governments.

This is trust in math, trust in code, not in humans.

I knew about bitcoin for a very long time, but in hindsight…I didn’t know anything.

Knowing about bitcoin, and realizing what bitcoin is, are two _completely_ different things!

In bitcoin circles we call this phenomena falling down the rabbit hole. It’s the process of slowly realizing what bitcoin is and then spending months and months and hundreds of hours obsessively learning as much as you can. My job is to make your fall down the rabbit hole as easy as possible.

If you’re curious.

CEO’s, politicians, millionaires, billionaires, presidents, academics, economists, computer scientists, engineers, athletes, media personal, and money nerds alike have all fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole, and their stories are much like mine.

Once you learn what bitcoin is, I guarantee you that you’ll be completely obsessed. There’s no going back.

## It took me 9 years of knowing about bitcoin, studying it, and dismissing it, before I realized.

Once I learned what bitcoin ACTUALLY was – once I fell down the rabbit hole – I too became obsessed, and would spend 4-8 hours a day every day, for over a year learning as much as I could.

I realized that bitcoin is unique, that there is nothing else like it in the history of the world.

And I’ll say that after all of my research, after hundreds of hours trying to find the catch, I’ve realized that bitcoin is completely inevitable and one of the most important projects going on right now in the world.

I’ve never been so sure about something in my entire life.

I’ve since decided I am going to dedicate the rest of my life to the digital money project. The most ethical, transparent, unbiased, and peaceful money in history.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giancarnevale_None_3f5a0d8d-adf0-4b24-8bbb-81d2a6f2665f-1024x1024.png)

## Bitcoin solves some of the most important problems plaguing humanity.

I like to call it the Manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age.

It’s an enormous, globally coordinated, research and development initiative. An open source software project aimed at building an unstoppable internet-native monetary system.

Bitcoin is more than just the best money ever made – it’s a programmable, permissionless and indestructible software network. A tech stack which implements fair, neutral money and protects human rights for 8 billion people.

Fighting back against authoritarianism and the encroachment of a digital Orwellian surveillance state.

Bitcoin is independent 21st century economic infrastructure existing outside of the global financial system. A monetary nuclear weapon if you will, bent on destroying fiat capitalism.

There’s a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize.

Bitcoin is the most important invention in economics and technology since the internet itself, it is the _internet of money_ and it will do to money what the internet did to information.

Bitcoin is a trust machine and is obsoleting trusted human institutions, fundamentally altering existing power structures, it’s a revolutionary invention that has changed the course of human history.

## Bitcoin is a global grassroots effort to build an escape catch from government fiat currencies.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money. And the corruption that comes with it.

Bitcoin is the separation of money and state.

Imagine the most powerful tool of civilization, pried from the clutches of the elite.

I’m mostly spreading the word because I think bitcoin is fucking crazy, I’m not saying you should buy any.

I’m here to warn you.

Bitcoin can’t be stopped, it’s a money that’s out of control.

It is by far the most secure computational network in the world, and (due to its game theoretic financially incentivized feedback loops) it will only imbed itself further and further into society.

If you don’t learn anything else about bitcoin for the rest of your life, just remember this:

## No one controls bitcoin, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it.

And **if** it can’t be stopped, shit’s gonna get wild….

# Intro

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/intro/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Forget everything you know about bitcoin. Forget everything you know about blockchain, and crypto.

Once you begin this journey there’s no going back. Those who venture down this path rarely return.

Once you understand bitcoin in all of its complexity, your life and your view of the world will change forever.

Be warned, there are more questions than answers that lie ahead of you.

If you’ve ever watched the show [Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_\(2004_TV_series\)), you know what it’s like to be sucked down a path of endless questions and an unquenchable thirst to know where it all leads.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_6058.jpg)

I want to make an all encompassing introduction to people, about what bitcoin actually is.

I know how revolutionary bitcoin is, but it’s a **really** tough subject to explain.

It took me a hundred hours to understand it, hundreds more just addressing my questions, and another few hundred after that trying to find the catch. I want to break it all down so you can understand in much less time than it took me haha. If I’m good at one thing its organizing knowledge.

There’s a lot of misinformation and scammy shit out there, and there needs to be more honest and dependable voices in the space. I have no financial reason to do this, I’m just passionate.

I want you to know, I too was skeptical about bitcoin for many years, even after studying it for countless hours. It’s very important that you learn about bitcoin in an adversarial way, don’t believe anyone, and cross check many sources. This is a huge commitment but I can tell you it’s worth it.

> Even after a couple of years exploring what is bitcoin you’ll find that you are still learning you’re still trying to understand what it is.
> 
> Andreas Antonopoulos

You should not be taking things at face value. Do not trust what you read without rationalizing it for yourself and always look for counter arguments. Read all the sources and then weigh each as unbiased as you can.

By being skeptical, it means you are a rational thinker and don’t just blindly accept things as they are. Which is an integral part of bitcoin, and a foundational value of all bitcoiners.

We have a saying in bitcoin, don’t trust, verify. I don’t want you to trust what I’m telling you, I want you to be inspired to learn more and discover your own truth.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png)

I knew about bitcoin for a long time, but in hindsight I didn’t know anything.

I started off like everyone else, thinking it would either make me rich, or that it was cute nerd money that would just fade away someday…

Knowing about bitcoin, and realizing what bitcoin is, are two completely different things.

In bitcoin circles we call this phenomena falling down the rabbit hole. It’s the process of slowly realizing what bitcoin is and then spending months and months and hundreds of hours obsessively learning as much as you can.

My job is to make your fall down the rabbit hole as easy as possible, if you’re curious.

You’re journey begins…with a simple question..

What is bitcoin?

# What is bitcoin???

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/what-is-bitcoin-2/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

It’s a question everyone asks but no one seems to have a good answer for.

John Oliver host of Last Week Tonight, said it best:

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1024x807.png)

Usually, the nerds will give you the technical definition:

> _Bitcoin is an open monetary transmission protocol_…blah blah blah

They’ll tell you what it does and how it works…but I heard these jargon filled definitions repeated for years and they never helped me, in fact they all made bitcoin seem boring and underwhelming.

Because of all of these boring definitions, Bitcoin is very misunderstood, I can tell you it’s not what you think it is.

It’s a totally new invention, revolutionary invention, and yet it’s shrouded in complex terminologies and elitist jargon.

> _Wow what a difficult task you have. At a very basic level you have to try to understand what is bitcoin. I can answer that question in for words. Bitcoin is digital money. But that doesn’t really capture it. It’s more like the Internet of money. But really it’s a consensus decentralized network based on Blockchain technology and proof of work algorithm that allows a digital token to act as a reward system for a game theoretical competition between decentralize minors to validate…and oh my it immediately goes off a cliff…._
> 
> Andreas Antonopoulos

The only things we have to explain what bitcoin is, are analogies of already existing technologies. But like the old saying goes, some analogies are helpful, but all are wrong.

## Some of my personal favorite bitcoin analogies are:

- Bitcoin is digital gold
- Bitcoin is gold that you can send from one phone to another…or from one BRAIN to another.
- Bitcoin is digital Super-Gold! Flying around the world at the speed of light, in an unstoppable PayPal
- Bitcoin is not just a bank account, but a full Swiss bank in your pocket
- Bitcoin is not just money on the internet, it’s the “Internet of Money”, a programmable monetary base layer internet protocol like TCP/IP or HTTP
- Bitcoin is the world’s largest, most secure, and most powerful supercomputer
- Bitcoin is like putting a calculator in charge of a global monetary and financial system
- Bitcoin is insurance against the debt bubble
- Bitcoin is like beanie babies, except for ending human slavery
- Bitcoin is a global anti-authoritarian political movement and a peaceful technological revolution

Bitcoins are “_magic internet tokens_” that you can store inside an app on a smart phone!!

_Silly little made up internet points, that for some reason people pay tens of thousands of dollars for…_

Bitcoin is the Manhattan project for human freedom. An escape hatch from our monopolistic fiat-capitalist global economic system.

## My personal favorite analogy for explaining bitcoin goes a little like this:

Imagine there’s this huge elephant, and a group of blind monks all walk up to it and start feeling it up to try and make sense of it.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-3-1024x742.png)

Right so one monk is petting it’s head, another is on its back feeling it’s ridged spine, there’s a monk clinging to one of its tusks, one pulling on it’s ears, another is tossing around it’s testicles, and yet another is rubbing on its toes.

The elephant of course is bitcoin in this analogy, there’s so many different pieces, it’s impossible for any one of us (the blind monks) to get a sense of it fully.

What makes it even more difficult to explain to new people is that there is no good elevator pitch for bitcoin, it truly depends on where you’re coming from, your prerequisite knowledge, and personal values.

> Ask three strangers what Bitcoin is, and you will probably get three very different answers. Any answer is necessarily shaped by past experience, political and economic beliefs, and an individual understanding of the world. Your personal set of ideas, your world view, defines where you are on the landscape of ideas.
> 
> Gigi

Explaining to the monk touching the elephant’s tusks what the testicles feel like is totally a lost cause.

My job of course is to lead you little monks all around the elephant, feeling all the parts to get a sense of something totally new. This of course requires _a bit of commitment_ from the student, however I can promise you that you will find it very rewarding if you stick around.

# Bitcoin is Digital Gold

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-digital-gold/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

## So, what exactly is Bitcoin?

![](http://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Logo.png)

_Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency!_

_It is the invention of digital scarcity i.e. digital property._

_It’s a new form of money and an independent global monetary network._

_It was invented by a person or persons under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto_.

_It’s an enormous breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems._

## In simple terms bitcoin is digital money.

But then again – so are dollars, euros, and yen.

We have PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Kohls cash, Credit Card reward points…heck you can even send money over Facebook messenger!

So while digital money is technically correct! It doesn’t really tell us anything…

What about digital gold? I’m sure you’ve heard that term tossed around, and honestly I do like it a lot better.

If I was explaining bitcoin to a 5 year old I would say that bitcoin is just gold that’s on the internet. In the same way that email is just internet mail, bitcoins are gold coins on the internet.

I like this comparison because calling bitcoin digital gold tells you it’s one of a kind, rare, and desirable. However bitcoin is more than just digital gold, its an evolution of gold. Where gold is great at moving value across time, its not great at moving value across space or scales.

Bitcoin is better than gold because it was specifically designed to fix all of its shortfalls. Including verifiability, portability, and divisibility.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Digital-Gold-1024x640-1.jpeg)

## The Gold Story

Gold was independently chosen by human civilizations for over five thousand years, civilizations that didn’t even have contact with one another. This is because gold just so happens to fulfill certain monetary properties which made it better money than any other asset on earth.

Why then did this ancient money become obsolete?

As civilization became global, and information moved at the speed of light, the only way for gold to keep up was for abstractions be build on top of gold. I.e. gold certificates. Paper money and bank spreadsheets that kept track of gold became money, instead of the gold itself.

The temptation to corrupt this system was too great for humanity to handle, and eventually more paper certificates were distributed than the underlying gold they were backed by. Eventually this system broke down and only unbacked paper/digital money was left.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-1024x1024.png)

## Why Bitcoin is Digital Gold

Bitcoin is digital gold because of its scarcity. It’s digital gold because its monetary policy is set in stone, and it’s too decentralized to be able to change. It is extremely secure and durable because of its extreme simplicity. Bitcoin is programmed to do one thing and one thing only, be a sound money settlement network.

It was the first digital asset, created an entire asset class, and was the invention of digital property itself. It’s the number one digital asset in terms of market cap and is worth almost as much as all other cryptocurrencies combined.

Bitcoin has been used to back other cryptocurrencies like stablecoins, is classified as a commodity by multiple sovereign regulatory agencies, and is held on the balance sheets of governments and corporations like gold or treasuries.

It was this track record, network effect, and long history of unchanging sound money properties which has made bitcoin the undisputed champion of sound money, and no other digital asset tries to compete with bitcoin on this narrative. It’s well understood in the digital asset ecosystem that bitcoin is the sound money project.

Once you understand that bitcoin is one of a kind and has no competition in the digital gold space, bitcoin’s value proposition cuts through the noise. Bitcoin is gold that can be programmed, sent anywhere on earth at the speed of light, and easily integrated into any digital application or program.

Gold failed as money because it isn’t portable, it is hard to verify, and it can’t be divided up to small value amounts. Limitations bitcoin was specifically designed to fix.

By fixing the shortcomings of gold, humanity has a new sound money which will compete against unbacked digital certificates. If gold was independently chosen by world civilizations for thousands of years due to its superior monetary properties, what does that mean for digital gold?

The crazy thing about bitcoin is though, this definition of “digital gold” is underwhelming. It is extremely simplified and doesn’t really explain why bitcoin is so revolutionary.

To steal another line from Andreas Antonopoulos:

> Saying bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone

# The Great Excel Spreadsheet in the Sky

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-great-excel-spreadsheet-in-the-sky/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png)

To understand how bitcoin works under the hood, you can think of it like an ultimate google doc, a shared spreadsheet in the cloud which is just a list of transactions. That’s literally all bitcoin is, it’s just a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.

At the most basic and fundamental level, bitcoin is just a ledger.

But instead of existing on the computers of banks, it exists on hundreds of thousands of computers all around the globe.

They all have the same ledger and everyone is in complete agreement with who sent money to who. 

If you’re having trouble putting an image of bitcoin in your head just think of a long digital excel spreadsheet, a calculator that keeps track of everyone’s money.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-1024x599.png)

So when people say, bitcoin isn’t real, it’s the same as saying your money in the bank isn’t real.

Except of course the bitcoin ledger is the most powerful and secure supercomputer on earth, can’t be hacked or shut down, and you have full autonomy over your savings.

When we’re talking about digital dollars or Zuckerberg bucks, the money ledger is stored on a central server. Basically the bank has a private computer that they keep all the records of everyone’s money.

The big difference is that Bitcoin’s ledger is a decentralized server. It’s hosted on tens of thousands of computers across the globe. Every bitcoin computer has a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain, for a fully transparent system. Bitcoin’s ledger is everywhere, its in the cloud.

_It’s the great excel spreadsheet in the sky._

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-6-1024x541.png)

Bitcoin is like an unstoppable PayPal, beaming digital super-gold around the world at the speed of light. It allows you to send and receive value, to and from anyone in the world, with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection.

The software operates on it’s own. All of bitcoins functions are facilitated by computer code. There’s no customer service you can call, no corporation that can change the rules, and no government that can stop your payments.

And anyone can access it, no exceptions.


# Bitcoin is Information

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-information/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Because bitcoin is just an internet ledger, bitcoin is pure information.

Bitcoin is a broadcast network where _the message is the money_. It’s is a software program for sending and receiving text messages (transactions).

It’s technically just 1’s and 0’s computer code, and cool math! There aren’t even any coins, it’s just a list of transactions and units.

You can send a bitcoin transaction via QR code…or in a picture. You can store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in your brain by memorizing 24 words.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_a_sloth_eating_an_ice_cream_cone_00dc77a9-6ea1-4a6b-878f-28892a4bf995-300x300.png)

_There are 233 bitcoins ($7,000,000) embedded in this image_

If you think about it from an adversarial perspective, this makes bitcoin extremely difficult to censor. You can send someone money with a meme!

You can text a bitcoin transaction with emojis, you can send it via satellite, you can send it over radio, you can save the file on an SD card, or mail it hidden in a love letter.

And once a bitcoin transaction is sent it can’t be undone.

Being digital also makes bitcoin extremely portable, frictionless, and easily integrated into our digital world.

Bitcoin is also programmable and can be designed around without permission. You can program money in countless of innovative ways with smart contracts and new complex financial infrastructure can be built on top of it.

Multi party custody solutions, payment channels, atomic swaps, batch transactions, time locks, vaults, prisms, micropayments, in-game currency integration, money streaming, insurance and options smart contracts, layer three web browsers, social networks, encrypted messaging…. and so much more that hasn’t even been invented yet.

Also with bitcoin, AI, robots, self-driving cars, drones, refrigerators, smart homes etc. can all hold and use bitcoin between themselves, a whole robot economy independent of ours.

This isn’t possible within our current credit based monetary system, since that requires passing of personal information and creditworthiness, a regulatory and security nightmare. Bitcoin on the other hand can be settled instantly with cash finality, zapped around at the speed of light anywhere on earth.

# What is Bitcoin?

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/what-is-bitcoin-3/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Bitcoin is the next evolution in money. It’s a 21st century monetary technology that will outlast our fiat currency system. Bitcoin is money for a type one civilization.

Bitcoin is not just a currency, it is a complete reworking of our global monetary system.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/btccity-1024x1024.png)

It is the first digital system of money that is completely decentralized.

Decentralized means its spread out, it exists everywhere, and no one is in control. This is the biggest differentiator between bitcoin and everything else that has ever existed.

> Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system based on a distributed digital ledger called a blockchain or timechain. The ledger includes transactions approved by the peer-to-peer network instead of a central authority.
> 
> Bitcoin Magazine

Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P transaction technology. It’s Peer-to-peer because there’s no one in the middle of the person you’re transacting with. Bitcoin is self running computer code which facilitates transactions automatically. It’s an independent third party software which holds no allegiances, and runs completely on its own. 

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/btchead-1024x1024.png)

So, what is bitcoin?

Bitcoin isn’t just money. It isn’t just a digital asset, and it isn’t just software.

Bitcoin is a network, an internet protocol, and a technology stack.

It’s layers upon layers of different apps, companies, software, hardware, networks, miners, implementations, alt-chains, smart contracts, decentralized protocols, services, tools and exchanges, which together form this unstoppable global public monetary infrastructure.

It’s a publicly accessible global bank, global monetary system and global financial system.

The reason bitcoin is so revolutionary is because it’s so unique. There’s never been a money that’s digital, programmable, finite and uncontrollable by humans. One which runs its own publicly available global monetary system outside of the purview of corrupt governments and corporations.

One which was engineered from the ground up to have all around superior monetary properties, and exist within an entire network of trust minimized protocols facilitating payments and contracts all open source, transparent, and available to all. No exceptions.

Bitcoin is the reinvention of money itself.



# Bitcoin is a Network

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-a-network/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Bitcoin is a global interconnected computer network made up of tens of thousands of nodes.

> A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected—either by cables (wired) or WiFi (wireless)—with the purpose of transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources. 
> 
> IBM

> A node is a connection point inside a network that can receive, send, create, or store data. A node is essentially [a computer] that can recognize, process, and transmit information to any other network node.
> 
> IBM

The nodes [computers] that make up the bitcoin network all run the same free open source software. This software is a language that allows these computers to interact with each other, and it governs the rules of the system.

Specifically, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, where every computer can communicate with any other computer directly. There’s no central server processing all of the data, and every computer is the same in the eyes of the network. There are no hierarchies, there are no master nodes that have any more power than any other nodes. Peer-to-peer means that bitcoin has a flat topology, every node is equal.

The nodes constantly pass around and verify transactions, and importantly, all of these computers have the same copy of the ledger. When someone makes a bitcoin transaction all computers in the network update their ledger together. Therefore bitcoin is on all of the computers in the network at the same time.

Because all nodes run the same software, all members of the network must adhere to the consensus rules and monetary policy in order to send and receive transactions. This makes it impossible for one single person or group to cheat the system or adjust the rules like they can with fiat money.

You can think of the bitcoin network kind of like a big mushroom, where there’s not really a brain. It’s all just one big blob. Or you could even think of Bitcoin as the brain itself, with electricity pulsing throughout the network to build one self-sufficient, autonomous, system.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_a_golden_altgorithm_with_data_flows_computer_code_81d7b512-4231-41e8-b63e-30951471b354-768x768.png)

Ai interpretation of a golden network

And to confuse you even more, bitcoin is also the name of the software that the nodes are running on the network.

So to recap: bitcoin the currency, is sent over Bitcoin the network, by computers running Bitcoin the software.



# Bitcoin is Time

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-time/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

You can think of Bitcoin as a kind of clock, it keeps track of time across the tens of thousands of computers that make up its network. A decentralized clock if you will, keeping track of which transactions came first. Ticking away for eternity.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9-1024x553.png)

Not only does bitcoin tell time, but Bitcoin is an invention of a new kind of time.

Blocktime.

Consider each new block added to the blockchain as a tick or a tock. The nodes within the bitcoin network come to a consensus of what the blocktime is and what transactions are included in each block.

Bitcoin facilitates this decentralized variable time in a trustless manner, i.e. there’s no one ‘keeping time’ the computers do this algorithmically without interference.

Obviously the problem of timekeeping is a big deal when dealing with a ledger, the order of who sent money to who is extremely important. If someone has control over the order of transactions they can literally control who has what money.

> It must be stressed that the _impos­si­bility of associ­ating events with points in time_ in distrib­uted systems was the unsolved problem that precluded a decen­tral­ized ledger from ever being possible until Satoshi Nakamoto invented a solution.
> 
> Gregory Trubet­skoy

The fancy term for this is Bitcoin is a distributed timestamp server, mitigating disputes in the order of transactions, completely autonomously, through a complex interplay of physics and game theory.

Bitcoin is automatic and can’t be shut off. No one controls the bitcoin time chain, it’s a computer system that exists beyond the control of humanity.

It exists as permanently and beyond human control as time itself.

# Bitcoin is Money

[May 4, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-money/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

In order to understand what bitcoin is, you have to understand what money is.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11-1024x576.png)

Money is a technology to move value across space, time and scales. Money stores your time and energy to be used in the future.

For example you can build cabinets and trade that for a day at a spa.

Money allows for complex exchange, trade specialization, and is fundamental for civilizations with advanced economies.

Money is in fact one of the oldest inventions of civilization itself, it even predates writing. In fact the first forms of writing were credit spreadsheets, of who owed what to whom. Money was so important in society we had to invent writing to keep track of it! It’s such a primal tool that we have even taught animals how to use it.

And it’s so ubiquitous that many of us take it for granted. 

Money is by far the most important good in an economy. It’s half of every single transaction. Not only is it extremely important on an individual level, but it’s one of the fundamental technologies in the development and sustainability of society itself.

Everyone intuitively understands that it’s always about the money. Always has been.

## Money isn’t Real

Because the value of money derives not from it’s consumption, but for the use to trade it for something later, money really is completely made up. It’s an abstraction, it’s a shared hallucination, it’s not real.

> Money is a shared cultural hallucination. It’s a shared delusion. We walk around and associate with other people on the basis of germ-ridden pieces of cotton printed with green ink…just by exchanging these pieces of cotton, you could create social relationships, transactions and trade– you could feed yourself, shelter yourself, etc. It’s based on the assumption that if you give me a dollar today, someone else will accept that dollar in exchange for something of value tomorrow. Value comes from the assumption that I can use it again.
> 
> Andreas Antonopoulos

Without the shared belief that something is money, it no longer becomes money. Money is the belief itself.

The real question is, why do people believe in certain monies over other ones? What makes a good, trustworthy money?

Bitcoin prioritizes trust and security for this reason. As you’ll soon understand, bitcoin was designed to be superior to all other forms of money so that it will be chosen voluntarily by the market in the long run.

## The Textbook Definition of Money

The textbook definition of money is that it serves three functions: as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. i.e. you save dollars in your wallet to buy something for dollars which has it’s price listed in dollars.

This definition is good for telling us which things are used as money currently, but it doesn’t tell us anything about how to judge new monies. What’s often overlooked in this definition is the spectrum of moneyness.

For one, money is location dependent. Just because you can’t buy a soda in Pittsburg with Mexican pesos doesn’t mean pesos aren’t money.

Additionally, money sometimes specializes in one of the three functions (think of gold as a store of value and Pesos as a medium of exchange). This is because even though gold has served as money and a store of value for thousands of years, it’s heavy and not easily accepted by merchants.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2-1024x535.png)

All money throughout history has taken one of two forms – either physical, like a coin, seashell, salt, cigarette, necklace bead, or paper bill. Or as information in the form of a list of transactions and debts owed. A spreadsheet if you will, like a bank account, clay tablet, or credit card. 

On the internet, money HAS to be information, since it’s the informational realm, and therefore money has to be a spreadsheet/ledger. This was the great challenge in creating commodity money within cyberspace, and why it took so long for bitcoin to be created.

## Bitcoin is Digital Commodity Money

The very nature of information is that it can be copied indefinitely, and before bitcoin there was no way to limit someone from just counterfeiting digital money without repercussion.

Sure you could just use fiat currency or trust a 3rd party like a bank or a corporation to keep track of your digital money, but debasement/counterfeiting of money has always been commonplace…and it’s the reason bitcoin was invented in the first place.

The true innovation of bitcoin was inventing a way to prevent digital money from being spent twice in an automated system without human control. Replicating the scarce nature of physical matter within cyberspace. Creating a new commodity that has limits on its supply, and can’t just be infinitely printed at the push of a keystroke.

This makes Bitcoin the invention of digital property. A scarce resource which is also digital.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1024x546.png)

The cool thing about digital property though is that you can build applications with it because it’s programmable. Property where you don’t need permission to launch a new tool or application, where there are no gatekeepers or barriers to entry, and where an open market of ideas can flourish.

Bitcoin is programmable money with so many use cases we haven’t even thought of yet. Due to its open source, permissionless nature, it will inspire innovation at the edges and the free marketplace of ideas can foster innovation.

## Bitcoin is Designed Money

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-3-621x1024.png)

[https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FDAS/bitcoin-first.pdf)

Not only is bitcoin digital, decentralized, programmable, commodity money, but it is also designed money.

Designed from the ground up with Austrian Economic sound money principles. Designed to have all of the best monetary properties, and designed to fix all of the shortcomings of gold.

Bitcoin isn’t just any money, it’s the best money ever made.

It’s sound money, it’s unstoppable money, it’s portable, verifiable, divisible, durable, fungible, and easily verifiable money.

You see, these qualities of money are extremely rare in nature. Gold was the best money for 5,000 years and yet it doesn’t even fulfill all of the traditional properties of good money.

(Which by the way, is why there was often a bi-metallic standard where silver fulfilled some of the divisibility and portability shortcomings with gold.)

Also unlike digital fiat money, bitcoin is borderless, permission-less, peer-to-peer, resistant to censorship, pseudonymous, extremely secure, and settles with cash finality.

Not only does bitcoin perfectly fit all of the traditional properties of good money, AND vastly improve on digital fiat, but bitcoin also has additional properties that were never before possible.

Bitcoin has perfect supply inelasticity, it’s programmable, it’s fully transparent, it’s unforgeable, unconfiscateable, trustless, and immutable.

Bitcoin isn’t just money, it’s the reinvention of money itself.




# Bitcoin is the Internet of Money

[August 7, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-the-internet-of-money/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Money is just the base layer of an economic system, just like BTC is the base layer of the bitcoin economy. The difference is bitcoin is also a network, a tech stack, and a protocol. Digital and programmable monetary infrastructure.

BTC is the native money of the internet, but bitcoin is much more than that. Bitcoin is the internet of money.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5-1024x1024.png)

In order for you to understand what bitcoin is, you unfortunately have to understand what the internet is.

> The **Internet** (or **internet**)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-1) is the global system of interconnected [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) that uses the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) (TCP/IP)[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-3) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a _[network of networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking)_…
> 
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)

The internet is programmable information. It is unrestricted, global, instantly transferable information. Bitcoin is programmable money – unrestricted, global, and instantly transferable money.

The internet is decentralized informational infrastructure, bitcoin is decentralized monetary infrastructure. The internet is an information protocol that can be built upon. Bitcoin is a money protocol that can be built upon.

> Bitcoin is digital public infrastructure for money, much like the internet is digital public infrastructure for information…it is owned by no one, and accessible to everyone. It is a public good that acts as infrastructure for civilization to utilize if they so please. 
> 
> Jack Mallers

Bitcoin democratizes value in the same way that the internet democratizes information.

The internet has allowed the coordination of humanity on a scale never before seen in human history, allowing for knowledge and revolutionary ideas to spread like wildfire. Bitcoin allows for unrestricted financing, pairing global coordination with unrestricted payments, fundraising, contracts, monetary autonomy and value exchange.

There’s no one in charge of the internet, there’s no central governing body dictating policy. And unlike all other cryptocurrencies, there’s no one in charge of bitcoin. This makes bitcoin the only true neutral money transfer protocol and the most similar to the internet protocol.

Bitcoin is less like an app, like AOL or Myspace, and more like TCP/IP, or UDP or SMTP. It’s part of the internet infrastructure responsible for transferring value. With bitcoin the information is the money, making it fully integrable into the internet stack.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6-987x1024.png)

Of course a monetary system not only needs money. It needs transfer services, it needs storage, accounting systems, exchanges, options contracts, trading platforms, insurance, crowdfunding, payment infrastructure, liquidity services, interoperable financial infrastructure etc. Bitcoin is the money but it’s also the platform where all other monetary system functionalities can be built.

> Bitcoin is the Internet of money. Currency is only the first application. And it’s core, Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever
> 
>  Andreas Antonopoulos -The internet of Money vol. 1

Bitcoin’s design allows for apps to be built on it’s periphery completely without permission. It’s open source and anyone can build a program that uses bitcoin and adds functionality to the network.

Complex custody solutions and transaction types unlocked by outputs like pay to script hash increase the types of possible transactions and improve user privacy and security. Upgrades to the software like Segwit have allowed for greater base chain scaling and for layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network to be built on top of bitcoin. And more recently the Taproot upgrade has unlocked additional smart contract functionality and privacy improvements to the bitcoin stack allowing for all kinds of options contracts and insurance capabilities.

### Bitcoin is the Foundation of a Global Monetary and Financial system

Those examples are just scratching the surface though, the bitcoin tech stack rabbit hole goes way further than this simple introduction. From the BTC Pay server, to statechains and sidechains, to RGB, ARK, Web5, Rootstock, Sovereign defi, Miniscript, Stratum V2, Federated Chaumian mints, Ordinals, L402, Stablesats, Taproot assets, Nostr marketplaces and many more. Of course this is not even counting other projects yet to be imagined or built with additional soft fork upgrades like CTV or Cross Input Signature Aggregation.

The industries that will integrate into the internet of money are truly boundless. Social media’s creator economies, AR and the VR Metaverses, eSports, and eCommerce will all be connected this global and frictionless monetary system.

What’s truly revolutionary though is that because bitcoin is open and permissionless monetary infrastructure, the internet of money isn’t limited to just humans. AI, robots, self driving cars, smart homes, drones, and the unimagined future of the internet of things can all leverage bitcoin’s programmability and use this public internet-based money infrastructure in a digital economy completely separate from our own.

> Bitcoin is the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation.
> 
> Mastering Bitcoin

The internet is a network of informational networks, bitcoin is a network of monetary networks. Different layers and protocols are being built on top, using the base layer as a settlement network and arbiter of ownership for more advanced use cases. The bitcoin stack is much more than just a money protocol, money is just scratching the surface.

If this is all still not making perfect sense to you, this is the key insight that flipped the switch for me personally and made me realize what bitcoin actually is:

Bitcoin will not necessarily be the “money” used for every transaction. It’s aiming for something much greater. Bitcoin will become the foundational protocol that the future digital economy and all global monies will be built upon.

We’re talking a new global financial and monetary system, remade on top of bitcoin. Transferring ownership of real world assets like stocks and bonds and fiat currencies themselves.

The reason this is so revolutionary is because it’s a system that’s based on the money and network being decentralized, independent, and uncontrollable.

A revolutionary economic system, built with technology. Based on rules not rulers.

The separation of money and state.

## Why is bitcoin the internet of money and not the larger crypto ecosystem?

The obvious reaction to this of course is, bitcoin is just one blockchain network among an entire crypto ecosystem, why BTC and not ETH, SOL, ADA, ALGO, TRX, MATIC, ATOM, AVAX…..

Isn’t bitcoin + (insert favorite Turing complete smart contract platform) + Layer 2 rollups + defi + metaverse + corporate FinTech platforms = the real internet of money?

While yes we will have a multi-coin world, and multiple smart contract platforms and decentralized nodes and relay infrastructure facilitating communications and payments, bitcoin is by far the strongest base layer internet of money. Bitcoin is unparalleled in it’s decentralization and immutable monetary policy, it’s a Turing incomplete blockchain which prioritizes simplicity, security, and durability.

And due to bitcoin’s strong monetary characteristics, even if other blockchains carry the weight of the IoM infrastructure in the future, bitcoin will always be the gold standard, the digital gold and the golden network that’s completely uncontrollable and immutable to mankind. Combining its neutrality, durability and programmability with an immutable bedrock foundation, bitcoin takes the slow and steady approach to outlast all other monetary infrastructure. Over time the bitcoin network will adopt the successful innovations in the larger crypto space to it’s superior network, leaving other platforms obsolete.

## Looking into the Future

To achieve the title of the sole money and monetary system of the future, bitcoin has many challenges ahead of itself. The entrenched fiat capitalist system and competitor crypto networks probably wont go away anytime soon. It took hundreds of years for the separation of church and state, and to think a system as complex as the global economy will be quick to transition is naïve at best.

As a pragmatist I would concede that the likelihood of full market share of the global economy within my lifetime is slim and might not happen for a hundred years. Instead, what I believe is that there will most likely be a multi-chain world and parallel fiat economy for the foreseeable future.

The reason why this is good is because bitcoin will always exist as a voluntary life raft for others to join (Instead of rapidly destroying the global economy, with bitcoin endogenously reborn from fiat ashes).

The fact that an internet based, neutral, and unchangeable economic system exists as an alternative will put a check on the expansionist policies of the other systems. They can exist in harmony as the cost of capital is rediscovered on the open market and the overleveraged fiat system course corrects.

Instead of a seismic shift and quick destruction of the old system, the bitcoin onboarding process (should) and will take time. That’s honestly what’s so exciting. We’re building revolutionary systems that will last generations.

# Why Should You Care?

[November 22, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/why-should-you-care/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-5.png)

The truth is, bitcoin doesn’t give a fuck about you.

Bitcoin is software, not sentient. It operates automatically and asks no human for praise. It already has over a hundred million adopters, is one of the largest assets in the world and settles trillions of dollars in value annually.

Bitcoin doesn’t need you, and bitcoin doesn’t ask for your approval.

So why should you care at all?

Let me start off by saying my objective here is not to get you to buy bitcoin. I leave investment advice to the finance bros.

To be honest, unless you learn how to manage your keys, self custody your funds in a hardware wallet, and truly believe in the philosophy of bitcoin, you really shouldn’t be buying any.

Bitcoin is also a voluntary system, you don’t have to use it, or like it, or buy into it. Unlike government money which is imposed without consent, you are free to avoid bitcoin.

_Why bitcoin?_ is not about why it makes a unique uncorrelated diversification hedge _blah blah blah_

This is a common misconception, bitcoin’s main purpose isn’t to be a speculative investment. What you have to understand is that it’s not about making money, it’s about fixing money.

_Why bitcoin?_ More so helps explain the basics in a way that I wish someone had laid out for me.

_Why bitcoin?_ is more like –

- “Why is bitcoin important?”
- “Why was bitcoin invented?”
- “Why will bitcoin win?”

WARNING: The passages that follow are only for the intellectually curious.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png)

Bitcoin is a greatly misunderstood technological revolution, often getting lumped in with monkey NFT’s, dog joke coins, and scams like FTX. You often hear pundits comment that it has no intrinsic value, or that it’s only use is to be traded. I don’t blame them, bitcoin is really difficult to understand.

And yet bitcoin is the best performing asset class this year and for the last decade. It refuses to die, continuously hitting all time highs. People have been calling Bitcoin a bubble since it was worth $30 in 2011. 12 years later it’s worth $30,000. Major international corporations, sovereign nations, and billionaires have bitcoin in their portfolio, and global regulation has only gotten increasingly favorable.

If you’re still ignoring bitcoin or calling it a bubble, maybe it’s finally time to to ask why you’ve been proven wrong again and again. Our egos are a major barrier preventing us from taking that initial step to study bitcoin.

I personally don’t think you shouldn’t be allowed an opinion on bitcoin if you can’t explain what it is, who made it, and why.

But once you study it, once it clicks, once you fall down the rabbit hole, you’ll realize that bitcoin is extremely powerful, extremely unique, and extremely important.

Bitcoin is the best money in history while also being a reinvention of money itself.

Its digital, decentralized, global, free market, and open-source programmable economic infrastructure will obsolete our antiquated fiat based system.

And it’s platform of inalienable human rights will safeguard liberty and the principles of the enlightenment for all of humanity for generations to come.

But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself.





# Bitcoin Will Save the World

[October 18, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-will-save-the-world/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/governed-by-a-protocol.png)

## **So, why is Bitcoin Important?**

##### Bitcoin is a Radical Techno-Economic Experiment

Most bitcoiners would disagree that I start off the bitcoin story here, I’m kind of skipping to the best part. But this is something that needs to be said, and in my opinion, said right at the beginning.

I bet you didn’t know this, but Bitcoin is by far the most important project in the world for securing our freedoms in an increasingly terrifying digital world.

For you see, digital money is a whole new evolution for how money can be exploited for political ends. The potential for corruption has far reaching consequences.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png)

I’m passionate about bitcoin because it’s literally our only hope.

Either bitcoin succeeds or the human race irrevocably falls into a technocratic dystopia.

Digital money is a uniquely novel tool where those who wield it can completely manipulate every aspect of a person’s life. Never before in history could you turn off someone’s money at will.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2-1024x560.png)

## The ability to control people’s money, and therefore controlling all of their actions in society, is an ultimate power unique to digital money.

The power to freeze someone’s life savings, to stop a donation to a protest movement, or prevent someone from buying food, is the power to control all of society, forever.

We’re entering a new technological age, one where a few economic elites can have extraordinary power never before dreamed of by dictators of the past.

The great digital transformation brings with it great risks.

A system of this kind would be the most powerful system of centralized control the world has ever known.

That power should never be trusted with the human race.

> Money is a system of control, those who control money have great power over the people who use it. As a result kings and governments have historically kept a tight control over money, just as they used to keep tight control over religion, and for the same reasons
> 
> _Andreas_ Antonopoulos

Without monetary freedom and securing of property rights, there can be no freedom of speech, of assembly, of religion, of self-defense, of privacy. Democracy itself is in risk of collapse.

This was actually my personal lightbulb moment which led me to devote my life to bitcoin.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/george.jpg)

You may think these things would be highly unconstitutional, and that they could never happen to us.

Except for the fact that history is full of these scenarios, and billions of people not in western democracies are at risk.

How many people actually stop to consider this attack vector? That we’re coming up against a great digital filter where an eternity of tyranny is at stake.

The ever growing bureaucratic state, combined with unlimited debt financing, trillions of data points from surveillance monitoring technologies and AI to process it all?

It’s a science fiction nightmare coming to life before our eyes.

## Bitcoin Fixes This

It’s a defensive technology to fight back against the greatest tyrannical power the world has ever known.

I bet no one has ever told you this, but this is what bitcoin is really all about.

Bitcoin is the encoding of human rights into software. Rights which are enforced and protected for the first time ever, not by humans, but by machine.

Bitcoin is a techno-economic experiment to provide an escape hatch from the monopoly of corruptible centralized money.

The separation of money and state.

By creating apolitical, transparent, and open-source digital monetary infrastructure, bitcoin protects human freedom in our new digital age. It’s an all powerful freedom technology that seeds the destruction of digital authoritarianism.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-4-746x1024.png)

## Sound Money is a Human Right

Everyone deserves the right to be able to save their money, in a way that’s protected from seizure and debasement.

> It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political Constitutions and Bills of Rights.
> 
> Ludwig von Mises

With it’s 21 million coin supply cap, hard coded issuance schedule, and immutable protocol design, Bitcoin was created to be the soundest money in history.

Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in fintech, information theory, economics and cryptographic systems, discovering immutable scarcity. The result of which, enables the freedom of humanity from the oppressive monetary exploitation of the state.

Bitcoin is money for our 21st century digital economy, it’s fully programmable and integrated with the internet. It can be transported around the world at the speed of light completely permissionlessly and is available to all of humanity.

It’s monetary policy can’t be captured by elites in any way shape or form. It’s a completely neutral third-party technology that was built by an anonymous programmer who left the project as a gift to humanity.

Bitcoin offers immutable private property rights, a savings account, and peer to peer money to every person on earth. Money which no one can censor, confiscate, debase, or otherwise steal, ending monetary oppression worldwide.

Bitcoin is unstoppable decentralized freedom technology for humans all over the world to escape authoritarian capital controls and financial repression.

## Money is the Bedrock of Society

Everyone intuitively understands this, money runs the world. It’s all about the money. Always has been. If money were to stop functioning, the fabric of society would break down.

Money coordinates practically all economic activity, and economic activity coordinates practically all aspects of life. Food, water, shelter, energy, and all of our supply chains, literally everything that requires human coordination.

Many civilizations throughout history have crumbled under monetary collapse, like hyperinflation, where the value of the currency is quickly destroyed.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3.png)

Bitcoin is important because it is insurance for the global economy.

It’s money that can’t be debased, and won’t hyperinflate. It isn’t the subject to political whim and it can’t ever be destroyed.

In finance terms, you could say bitcoin is a credit default swap on fiat currencies.

The truth is, we are in the largest economic experiment in human history. Never ending deficits, artificially low interest rates, and debt to GDP levels soaring.

Ever since I was 13 year’s old, I’ve been obsessed with economics and our federal debt. The aftermath of the global financial crisis and the unsustainable debt expansion has always fascinated me.

This is the most important problem facing humanity, and no one seems to understand or give a shit.

Bitcoin offers a way out of this nonsense. An escape hatch to a better future.

Bitcoin is like Noah’s ark, it’s a parallel economic system that could absorb all of the wealth on the planet and still function as money in case of a global systematic monetary collapse.

==Literally saving the fucking world.==

Which in my opinion, makes it one of the most important projects in history.

## Bitcoin Solves Several Immense Problems for Civilization:

Bitcoin protects property rights for 8 billion people and banks the underprivileged classes of the planet.

It solves financial crises, inflation, and debt slavery, and it defends civil rights in a future surveillance state.

It solves the shortcomings of gold, returning financial sovereignty to the individual, and it puts the spending power of state actors and large corporations in check.

It de-financializes our Ponzi scheme fiat-capitalist economy and gives everyone in the world access to the best savings technology ever invented.

Bitcoin (decentralized money) will be as important and transformative as: the printing press (decentralized production of information) the separation of church and state (decentralized religion) three branch republics and federalism (decentralized government) and the internet itself (decentralized information).

## Bitcoin is the Manhattan Project for Human Freedom

Just like the Manhattan project to build the atom bomb, some of the brightest minds all around the world have come together to work on this extremely powerful technology. However, instead of an ultimate project for destruction, bitcoin is an ultimate project for freedom.

Thousands of core developers, tens of thousands of node operators, merchants, corporations, investors, software engineers, human rights activists, keyboard warriors, and money nerds have all come together to work on The Bitcoin Project.

Bitcoin isn’t just money. It’s is an enormous, globally coordinated, research and development initiative. An open source software project aimed at building an unstoppable internet native monetary system. A collection of technologies and digital infrastructure that form the basis of a global monetary foundation.

A tech stack which implements fair, neutral, digital money, available for all of humanity. Fighting back against authoritarianism and the encroachment of a digital Orwellian surveillance state.

There’s a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-768x1024.png)

The things that are being built are truly mind blowing, and combine to form an unstoppable network of financial services. Multi-layer scaling, privacy solutions, multi party custody, atomic swaps, batch transactions, time locks, micropayments, money streaming, insurance and options smart contracts, decentralized exchanges, decentralized market places, sovereign identity, liquidity services…

Not to bore you any more but here is a non exhaustive list of world changing bitcoin infrastructure projects that you can look up at your leisure:

Lightning, Liquid, ARK, Federated Chaumian mints, eCash, Ordinals, L402, Web 5, Stablesats, Taproot assets, Whirlpool, CTV/APO/Covenants, BitVM, Stratum V2, MPC, DLCs, Eltoo, Ark, Coinpools, Statechains/Mercury layer, Spacechains, Splicing, Channel Factories, Hierarchical channels, Spiderchains, The Enigma Network, Chainway/ZK Rollups, RGB, Radient, Prime, Miniscript, Tapscript, Spirit of Satoshi, BOLT12, LSP, Carbonado, Prisms, BTC Pay server, Munstr, Rootstock, Sovereign defi, CivKit and Nostr marketplaces etc.




# Why was Bitcoin Invented?

[November 22, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/why-was-bitcoin-invented/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

## Bitcoin’s History

Let’s pull back the timechain for a moment here…

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, was a cypherpunk. The cypherpunks were a group of rouge anti authoritarian computer programmers, digital liberty advocates and anarchists.

Basically a bunch of computer nerds, back in the 90s, who saw the writing on the wall, and were terrified of a future Orwellian surveillance state.

So they decided to take freedom into their own hands, creating technology that no government or corporation could stop.

And digital money was their holy grail.

The cypherpunks understood that without privacy and financial freedom all other rights are at stake.

And their breakthrough in inventing bitcoin was aimed at securing human liberty far into our digital future.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cypher.jpg)

## Bitcoin is Designed Money

It’s a tale as old as civilization itself.

Humans can’t be trusted to maintain a currency. Throughout history we have succumb to the temptation of making money without working for it.

Go figure.

So we used technology to invent a solution. It’s literally that simple.

Bitcoin is just an invention, like email or smartphones. Except it’s a new kind of native internet money, one which has a programmatic supply cap and can’t be manipulated.

Completely designed from the ground up to be the best money ever made, and is so powerful and unique that it has no competition.

# Why Will Bitcoin Win?

[November 22, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/why-will-bitcoin-win/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

## Bitcoin is Digital Gold

Gold was independently chosen by every society as money for thousands of years due to it’s inherent monetary properties. Bitcoin is digital gold, it improves on all of gold’s qualities, making it the best money in human history.

It will be chosen voluntarily by the market because of it’s monetary superiority.

That’s why I don’t care about convincing you to buy any. If I’m right, you’ll demand to be paid in bitcoin someday.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Giancarnevale_None_d19b2e2b-e60f-4802-a990-bfd5271d130b.png)

## Bitcoin is Obvious

Bitcoin is so good you don’t believe it at first. But it is literally so obvious if you take the time to learn about it.

Bitcoin is shorting government currency, and going long on technology and free markets. Basically the easiest trade ever.

If you don’t understand the problem with our current monetary system, and you don’t understand what bitcoin is, of course you wouldn’t understand why bitcoin is the solution. But for those who have ventured down the rabbit hole and come out believers there’s no going back.

Bitcoin is the greatest monetary asset ever developed and has no competition.

I can’t believe so many people have their heads in the sand.

I had been told by many people over many years about bitcoin and yet I ignored them. When I finally realized what Bitcoin was I felt so stupid, like I was the last to know about this revolutionary game changing technology and the greatest asset the world has ever known.

After years and years and hundreds and hundreds of hours of rigorous study, I have not changed this position, and I honestly feel bad for people who don’t understand yet.

This is why I’m dedicating my life to educating others and helping them with the difficult technical challenges of bitcoin onboarding.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1-963x1024.png)

One of my favorite tweets of all time

## We’re Still so Early

We’re monetizing the future global reserve asset in real time and hardly anyone understands what it is.

Right now the tools and scaling solutions are too primitive and not liquid enough. Most people don’t understand bitcoin, don’t care about it, or worse, are steadfastly against it.

But as the ecosystem gets built out and people start building unique solutions, the simultaneous breakdown in the fiat system will propel bitcoin holders and institutions to adopt magic internet money. The 20th century financial instruments denominated in fiat currency and lubricated by government debt won’t last.

There will be a tipping point in bitcoin acceptability by merchants. Right now it’s a struggle to get businesses to use and accept bitcoin, rooted in the lack of regulatory clarity, low adoption, and volatility.

Eventually when the S curve starts to mature, and the bitcoin rush commences, everyone will voluntarily accept bitcoin as payment because it’s the best money ever invented.

By that time, the UX of bitcoin adoption will be basically flawless and it’ll be extremely easy to integrate for any online business.

The management of bitcoin too will improve. Personal private Ai assistants that we can run on a home server will become ubiquitous and will be able to manage our bitcoin for us. Maximize privacy in transactions, work to manage liquidity and sidechain staking, and overall work with the myriad of decentralized protocols, defi, bifi, nostr, for full financial sovereignty, even for people who don’t have the time to learn themselves.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giancarnevale_None_14e8a946-4045-460b-b563-ca7eb66c8e75.png)

## Bitcoin is Immortal

A future dystopia is scary, but highly unlikely. The genie is out of the bottle and bitcoin is here to stay.

Because of the networks extremely secure proof of work consensus model, game theory incentive structure, decentralized node infrastructure, immutable consensus rules, lack of central governance, and global adoption – Bitcoin is effectively the most secure and reliable protocol outside of the internet itself.

It is extremely durable and resilient, even being considered anti-fragile as it grows stronger when facing resistance.

My favorite description of bitcoin’s over-the-top security is that it’s comparable to the entire US military being tasked to defend a small playground deep in the mountains.

## Bitcoin is Inevitable

Bitcoin is the true, free market asset. If you understand free markets than you’ll see why its inevitable. A monetary policy and trustless infrastructure which can’t be coopted by factions, and instead is run automatically by a distributed network of computers.

It is extremely unique and non-replicable due to it’s network effects and unparalleled decentralization.

Bitcoin is already much larger than other crypto projects, and dwarfs all direct competitors. It’s currently worth 50% of the entire crypto market, and almost 3X more than ALL OTHER cryptocurrencies (other than ETH and Stables), COMBINED. The entire DeFi market is orders of magnitude smaller than just bitcoin.

Meaning, that all of the game theoretic shelling points onto a singular monetary good combined with the unique strengths of bitcoin, make it an uncontested champion for digital gold and the primary money of the internet.

It’s supply is capped at 21 Million coins, with only 7% to be mined over the next hundred years and with 75% of it’s current supply held by religious zealots of the technology. With a total addressable market in the hundreds of trillions, and the seamless accessibility of the technology, the supply shock and deflationary spiral will be a feedback loop for mass adoption.

## Bitcoin is a Revolutionary Invention That Has Changed the Course of Human History

It’s the best money ever designed and best savings technology ever invented.

It’s extremely liquid, has a completely open global market, open 24/7 to anyone and anything anywhere, no exceptions.

All attempts at stopping bitcoin are impossible and will only slow it down. Trying to stop superior technology never works. Especially a bottom up merit based market chosen money. I wish everyone luck in trying to stop digital gold.

Even if bitcoin’s only value amounts to being a ‘store of value’ that still is an addressable market of hundreds of trillions of dollars.

If we’re talking about international settlement then we’re talking quadrillions of dollars, and if we’re talking the base layer money and monetary infrastructure for the planet then bitcoin is worth the _entire economy of the future!_

You see, we’re aiming for everything. Worst case scenario is still revolutionary, and there’s no going back now.






# Absolute Scarcity

[October 23, 2022](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/absolute-scarcity/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

_Money doesn’t grow on trees, because if it did we would call it leaves._

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_money_tree_69733849-e2aa-4759-99d7-050ca608ab2b-1024x1024.png)

Everyone intuitively understands that in order for something to have value it must also be scarce, or hard to come by. It’s the same reason air is free and a Denny’s Grand SlamTM isn’t.

Bitcoin has value because it is absolutely scarce – there is a cap of 21 million bitcoins that can ever be mined. Before bitcoin was invented, digital assets could be infinitely copied, there was no such thing as digital property, and scarcity in the digital realm was thought to be impossible.

The invention of Bitcoin marked a fundamental breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems, enabling absolute scarcity. And after 15 years and thousands of other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin remains the only money that is perfectly scarce and verifiably finite.

This is bitcoin’s unique value proposition.

Bitcoin is often compared to digital gold because of its scarcity, but unlike gold bitcoin is finite. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This limit will never change thanks to bitcoin’s network effects, unparalleled decentralization, incentive structure, and governance model.

This limit is called bitcoin’s hard cap, it is written into Bitcoin’s source code and enforced by all participants running the bitcoin software.

You can think of bitcoin as the Mona Lisa, or a plot of land in Manhattan, or Wu-Tang Clan’s _Once Upon a Time in Shaolin_ broken up into a couple quadrillion little pieces. When you own bitcoin you own a piece of something unique, something limited and one of a kind.

The reason this is so special is because no other money or digital asset possesses an unchangeable absolutely scarce monetary policy on the level of bitcoin. Bitcoin’s rules are set in stone, it’s the most certain, reliable, and credible monetary policy of any digital asset and of any currency.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dollabtc-768x435.png)

Bitcoin is backed by its unique value proposition as being the only monetary good that ever has, and will ever be, absolutely scarce. This certainty of its supply and supply schedule is unique to bitcoin and can’t be recreated.

This fixed supply is the reason bitcoin is the perfect store of value, and is the best savings technology ever invented.

The intrinsic value of this one-of-a-kind absolutely scarce monetary policy, paired with bitcoin’s perfect supply inelasticity and unparalleled stock to flow ratio, will act like a game theoretic Schelling point to global bitcoin adoption.

As Chris Kuiper and Jack Neuruter of Fidelity Digital Assets describe in their report, [Bitcoin First](https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/sites/default/files/documents/bitcoin-first.pdf): 

> One of the primary reasons investors attribute value to bitcoin is its scarcity. Its fixed supply is the reason it has the ability to be a store of value.

Bitcoin’s predictable and fixed supply has been specifically cited by wealth managers like [Paul Tudor Jones](https://news.bitcoin.com/paul-tudor-jones-bitcoin-apple-google/) and financial institutions such as Fidelity and BlackRock to highlight this unique investment thesis.

The examples of legacy financial institutional involvement into bitcoin are vast, however notably Fidelity is adding bitcoin to its [401k products](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/fidelity-offers-401k-investors-access-to-bitcoin-a-retirement-plan-first.html), and adding bitcoin trading to its [brokerage platform](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/fidelity-considers-allowing-individual-investors-to-buy-bitcoin), and BlackRock is providing its clients with [direct bitcoin exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/blackrock-partners-with-coinbase-6363233) as well as a spot bitcoin [private trust](https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrock-launches-spot-bitcoin-private-trust-us-clients-2022-08-11/) and became the largest financial institution in the world to file for a [spot bitcoin ETF.](https://www.investopedia.com/blackrock-files-for-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-7547609) In addition to Blackrock several other financial giants have submitted their own ETF’s including VanEck, ARK Invest, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, Bitwise, Fidelity and Invesco – totaling over 27 Trillion in assets under management.

The sectors that bitcoin aims to disrupt are MUCH larger than you could possibly know, we’re talking multi-trillion dollar industries all over the world.

_We’re talking_ pristine international collateral! A global monetary settlement machine, central bank reserve asset, corporate treasury reserve asset, pension and retirement fund savings technology, inflation hedge, fiat credit default swap insurance, seizure resistant store of value, emerging market currency, international remittance network, and even the base layer infrastructure of the entire global economy.

The 2020’s have so far seen massive institutional adoption as bitcoin’s supply cap, security, immutability, and revolutionary potential have been recognized by the larger financial ecosystem.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-12.png)

If scarcity makes money a good store of value, and the better the store of value the harder the currency, absolute scarcity makes bitcoin the hardest money ever invented.

Over time as the market prices in this unique property, the demand and liquidity will continue to increase. With a fixed and perfectly inelastic supply, the price of bitcoin will rise, drawing more people in, and fueling a positive feedback loop of adoption and price appreciation.

# **But but but, there are thousands of other coins?!**

People who are new to Bitcoin and crypto misstate that bitcoin is not scarce because there are thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies. However, bitcoin isn’t fungible with these other currencies. It’s like saying the Mona Lisa isn’t unique because there are millions of other paintings.

It is true that cryptocurrencies on the whole are not scarce, but bitcoins on the bitcoin network are. Anyone can clone bitcoin’s open-source software at any time, launch their own coin, or split off of bitcoin’s main chain, but no one can carry over its acceptance, brand recognition, security or absolute scarcity.

In a similar way anyone can copy the game of chess and make up new rules, expand the board and include new pieces, but they would have to convince everyone else to buy new sets and learn the new rules. A feat far easier in concept than reality. In fact, people have been copying bitcoin’s code since 2011, yet no cryptocurrency has come close to matching bitcoin’s market capitalization and adoption. Currently, bitcoin makes up 94% of the market cap of all proof of work cryptocurrencies.

People will continue to value bitcoin specifically because of its unique and unchanging properties. Bitcoin has the largest network effect, highest liquidity, most reliable monetary policy, and is provably finite. It’s the most secure blockchain by many orders of magnitude and is the only cryptocurrency undeniably classified as a commodity. Once you understand that bitcoin has no competition, its unique value proposition of absolute scarcity will cut through the noise.

# **Why Bitcoin is the Only Money with Absolute Scarcity**

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, left the project in 2011 and the current maintainers of the project are numerous and decentralized. There’s no corporation, foundation, or group which controls the protocol. Bitcoin now runs on its own. And as the past few updates to the software have shown, it is now infeasible to change bitcoin’s consensus rules. The laws of bitcoin are as unchanging as the laws of physics.

Bitcoin was able to achieve this level of decentralization through years of obscurity afforded to it by being the first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin didn’t have a marketing team, it grew under the radar and didn’t have a market price for the first year of existence.

However, once people realized they could create their own monies, competition exploded.

The paradox of new blockchains is that centralization is necessary to manage their launch process, spearhead development, fund new coin marketing efforts, and to continuously grow their chain’s technological capabilities in response to this competitive environment. New crypto projects need to differentiate themselves from bitcoin, and from each other, in order to gain market share and drive adoption.

The challenge is not creating an absolutely scarce system. The technology is already invented, and bitcoin can be easily replicated. No, the challenge is a sociological one, making people care.

As with any new project, a considerable amount of investment is required to launch, grow, and maintain new cryptocurrencies. To bootstrap these projects it is necessary that these foundations and developers also maintain a significant level of governance over the protocol’s direction. Centralization is a natural outcome based on the efficiencies gained when monetizing these networks. To finance the growth of these cryptocurrencies pre-mines are common and these founders maintain a large fraction of coin equity, which further disincentivizes them from leaving their projects. True decentralization requires a relinquishing of power and an acceptance that their project could become irrelevant.

As a result, every other cryptocurrency created after bitcoin has a developer team, foundation, or a CEO with control over their networks and with the ability to roll back and hard fork the blockchain if necessary, or if mandated. They are centralized and susceptible to the whims of man. Similar to the monetary policies of Government fiat currencies, their rules can be altered by powerful special interests and their scarcity isn’t credible or certain.

It’s worth noting that most cryptocurrencies don’t even have a limited supply by design. Other crypto projects have moved on and are focused on other blockchain use cases. While some of these projects are incremental improvements in technology, they don’t come close to the long term investment potential that bitcoin does.

It’s now commonly understood in the crypto ecosystem that bitcoin is the sound money project, and other chains don’t really aspire to challenge bitcoin on this narrative. Doing so would be an uphill battle against its massive network effect, and would require centralization to get off the ground. Their hardness isn’t a selling point and their scarcity isn’t guaranteed.

Because of the unique launch of the bitcoin protocol, and the centralizing force of bootstrapping a new cryptocurrency, absolute scarcity can’t be replicated and is a once a human history event.

# **Why is Bitcoin Scarce?**

Bitcoin’s main technological breakthrough was to solve the double spend problem and create uncopiable units of currency in cyberspace. The nature of information is that it can be copied indefinitely, and before bitcoin there was no way to limit someone from just counterfeiting digital money without repercussion. Sure you could trust a 3rd party like a bank or a corporation to keep track of your digital money, but debasement/counterfeiting of money has always been commonplace and absolute scarcity was impossible.

The problem with money is that those who control it are incentivized to make more of it for themselves.

> _Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin’s total circulation is limited to 21 million coins._ 
> 
> Satoshi Nakamoto (_v0.3 announcement_ 7/6/2010)

The beauty of bitcoin is that there is no trust required of a central institution, bitcoin’s scarcity is encoded in software. Satoshi designed bitcoin to be decentralized, trustless, and absolutely scarce to prevent humans from debasing the currency and inflating its supply.

The whole point of bitcoin is to remove the control and issuance of money from the hands of humans.

Bitcoin’s absolute scarcity is a guarantee that your money can’t be diluted by central banks or by special interests. It’s a protest against debasement, and a revolution in property rights.

# **How Does Bitcoin Ensure its Scarcity?**

### **Immutability of the Consensus Rules**

There are many different layers to bitcoin, which are all beautifully woven together in a ‘rube Goldberg machine’ type-of-way to ensure its absolute scarcity is protected.

Bitcoin acts as a trust machine, enforcing its ruleset through a self running computer software. Trust is removed entirely, this is a system that reaches consensus without human decision making. Everyone in the network enforces the rules independently in a decentralized fashion.

Decentralized means there is no center, there’s no head of Medusa to cut off, bitcoin is more like water existing everywhere all at once. No person, corporation or government controls the network. Because there is no center, there’s nothing to control, nothing to take over, and nothing to shut down. Bitcoin also has no geographical boundaries, it’s a global network that runs on top of the internet and exists outside of the jurisdiction of nation states. This makes bitcoin extremely resistant to censorship and control, and practically impossible to change. This decentralization is the key to bitcoin’s immutability.

Digital scarcity, the bitcoin ledger, it is real because there’s a consensus. Every node in the Bitcoin network runs the bitcoin protocol software independently, and will reject any blocks that don’t conform to the rules. In order to change the consensus rules you would have to convince tens of thousands of nodes to adopt these changes. Like chess, if you change the rules for yourself you do not change it for all other players around the world.

The network architecture brilliantly assigns those in charge of the consensus rules to have a strong incentive to resist any changes to bitcoin. Nodes run the bitcoin protocol because it’s in their financial interest as users of the currency to not debase their own supply. This is the powerful effect of bitcoin’s game theory at work.

Miners on the other hand, who would have an incentive to expand their supply, do not control the rules and are instead competing to mine the chain that people value. If there was a split in the network, where some nodes continued running the bitcoin software and others created a new coin without absolute scarcity, miners would choose the chain where they would most profit, an “if you can’t beat them, join them” game on a massive scale.

In fact this game theoretic outcome has been tested and validated, when, in 2017, a critical mass of bitcoin corporations and 95% of miners all flagged support to change bitcoin’s consensus rules to improve Bitcoin’s scalability. Ordinary users however, simply refused to update their nodes, and the hard fork was eventually defeated. The “blocksize war” of 2015-2017 is where bitcoin’s immutability was put to the test, and its outcome has forever cemented bitcoin’s absolutely scarce money supply.

### **Bitcoin’s Source Code**

Bitcoin’s hard cap is mathematically determined due to a process known as the Halving. About every 4 years, or every 210,000 blocks, the mining reward is cut in half. That means the number of total bitcoin that enter circulation once a block is mined gets smaller and smaller as the total number of bitcoin approaches 21 million.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Picture255-1024x538.png)

The timing of these halving events is assured by another hard coded bitcoin process known as the difficulty adjustment. Even if the number of miners multiplied by trillions in a couple of days, bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment would just change how much processing power it takes to mine a block, acting as an automatic pacemaker to keep the supply perfectly inelastic regardless of demand. Bitcoins difficulty adjustment is so powerful, all of the energy of the Sun could be funneled towards mining blocks and still no more bitcoin could be created any faster. The last ever bitcoin will take close to forty years to mine, and the final block reward will be sometime around the year 2140.

# **Why Scarcity is Vital for a Good Money**

Bitcoin is money. It’s not a company or a product, therefore it doesn’t have cash flows and its value can’t be derived through familiar methods. Bitcoin is what’s known as a monetary good, and its value is instead derived from its ability to better satisfy the characteristics of good money. Some of these monetary attributes were described thousands of years ago by Aristotle and they still hold true to this day. They include durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability, acceptability, and of course, scarcity.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Properties.png)

https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/research-and-insights/bitcoin-first-revisited

Bitcoin has many qualities that make it good at being money and bitcoin’s absolute scarcity is one of the main differentiators. It is bitcoin’s superiority in satisfying these monetary attributes which makes it a better money than anything that has come before or since. Bitcoin’s mathematically provable absolutely scarce supply cap is the greatest assurance that value will be preserved into the future and can’t be diluted.

> _Economic actors are incentivized to choose the money that best holds its value across time, is most widely accepted, and most clearly conveys market pricing information. All three of these qualities are rooted in scarcity: resistance to inflation ensures that money retains its value and ability to accurately price capital across time, which leads to its use as an exchange medium_
> 
> Robert Breedlove

When monies compete, scarcity often determines the winner. However scarcity isn’t about how rare an asset is, in fact commodities that are extremely rare to the point where no one owns them lack liquidity and therefore can’t even be used as money. Bitcoin has the advantage of being infinitely divisible so its rarity/finite supply doesn’t lessen it’s usefulness as money.

More important than rarity’s impact on scarcity is money hardness. Hard money refers to money that has an unforgeable costliness, where it isn’t easy to produce or counterfeit. Hard money also doesn’t loose it’s value quickly, but acts like a store of value for a long period of time. Money that grows on trees would be considered soft money, abundant and easy to make without much work, and inflates and loses value quickly. Gold is the classic example of hard money, because it takes a lot of work to mine, and can be stored for thousands of years without deteriorating.

If money is printed faster than the rate at which the economy grows, then each unit of currency will be worth less overall. This is the definition of inflation, and why bitcoin’s hard cap and halvenings make it inflation proof. A hard inflation proof money will always be more valuable in the long run than the alternative, which is why hard monies have historically replaced softer ones throughout history.

### **Stock-to-flow**

Bitcoin’s halving events reduce the rate at which bitcoin is mined, where every four years the amount of bitcoin mined in each block gets cut in half. This means that the number of bitcoins produced per year will get smaller and smaller as the limit of 21 million is approached.

In fact, there is only about 10% left of the bitcoin supply to be mined over the next 118 years, as the rate of bitcoin grinds to a halt. This in effect means that the total number of bitcoin (the stock) is much greater than new bitcoin being created (the flow).

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Picture23.png)

This ratio of stock-to-flow is what gives a money it’s hardness, since this rate determines how much more currency will enter the market and dilute the existing stockpile. The harder the money, the more resistant it is to change in supply.

The total supply of gold increases at about 1.6% per year. If you divide the total amount of gold ever mined by the amount produced each year, you would get a stock-to-flow ratio of approximately 62. The ratio measures how many years it would take to double the supply.

Gold currently has the highest stock-to-flow of any commodity on earth. Having a high stock to flow ratio is actually quite an uncommon feature for commodities. Elements like rhodium are actually much rarer than gold, but due to rhodium’s importance in industrial processes, the total stockpile gets used up quite quickly so its stock-to-flow is lower. Gold has the advantage of being extremely chemically stable so its stockpile doesn’t erode over time, it’s been mined by humanity for thousands of years, and it is difficult to mine quickly.

Bitcoin’s current inflation rate is 1.7% and it’s current stock to flow is 57 which is quite similar to gold. When the block subsidy halving occurs in 2024 bitcoin’s stock to flow ratio will roughly double to about ~120, and in 2028 it will roughly double again to about ~240. Unlike gold the total supply of bitcoin will never double, and its stock to flow will keep multiplying to infinity.

Because of bitcoin’s terminal supply and halving events, bitcoin is the hardest money that has ever existed.

### **Money Hardness and Competition**

Throughout history many different items have been used as money. From beads and seashells, to stones, salt, and livestock. Over time, technological progress and financial incentives accelerated the production of these goods, decreasing their stock-to-flow, diluting their value and their usefulness as money.

However, interestingly enough, despite all improvements in technology the stock-to-flow ratio of gold and silver have remained relatively constant. This is because as we discovered better mining techniques easy deposits of these metals were depleted and only the harder to reach areas remained. As a result, gold and silver (whose stock-to-flow is second only to gold) were the main monies for thousands of years.

Whenever gold and silver (the monies with the highest stock to flow) came into contact with any other money, it was always gold and silver that won out. This is because as goods with the lowest debasement rate they were able to store their wealth better than other goods, making them more useful as money.

Eventually it was gold that succeeded over silver as the global reserve asset, as paper money derivatives made silver’s medium of exchange advantages obsolete. And then gold was of course eventually co-opted by governments and was replaced by fiat currencies due to their superior monetary attributes, divisibility, portability and verifiability. Weaknesses that bitcoin doesn’t have.

# **Price Impact**

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fidelbill.png)

In the short run bitcoin’s supply issuance halvings historically have correlated with a cycle of price appreciation.

Every 4 years bitcoin’s price spikes and settles to new all time highs, closely following the supply shocks of the decrease in mining rewards. Additionally, bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment ensures perfect supply inelasticity, regardless of demand. This means that even though the monetary value of each block is increased, no matter how hard you dig you can’t inflate the supply. Any other commodity that rises in value incentivizes people to create more supply which then offsets the price rise.

Not so with bitcoin. As less bitcoin enters the market against its accelerating adoption rate, there isn’t enough supply to meet demand so the price rises. The price rise isn’t offset by increased production, so the price keeps rising. This accelerated rise usually follows a brief bout of hysteria and the price shoot higher than equilibrium in a FOMO mania that then results in a correction and a price crash.

It’s commonly understood that the real catalyst historically for price appreciation has been global liquidity, however as time goes on and accelerated global monetary liquidity continues to be entrenched, (either through transparent quantitative easing and yield curve control or via shadow liquidity injections through innovations in global financial plumbing) the inability for new bitcoin to be created will become an accelerated catalyst for price appreciation.

These cycles of user adoption, accumulation, supply decrease, and price appreciation are fed by bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio decreasing every four years, correlating with bitcoin hardening as money and growing increasingly scarce. Regardless of the short term volatility that the supply shocks initiate it’s bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment, perfect supply inelasticity, and hard cap which keeps bitcoin absolutely scarce and leads to its upward price trajectory over the long run.

However, the slowly dwindling new supply issuance isn’t the full story. The vast majority of bitcoin has already been mined so the largest amount of supply that could enter the market and dampen price appreciation would come from existing holders. A lot of great work has been done to examine the long term and short term holder supply and the potential impact on the market, specifically the work done by [glassnode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnAa8AbZ7Ac) and [The Rational Root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT9x5oU6yYo). If you would like to explore those metrics further I can’t recommend their work highly enough.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13-1024x589.png)

In summary however, existing long term holders are the least likely to sell the majority of their holdings since these are exactly the people who understand bitcoin the most and are the most adamant of the evergreen price appreciation.

The absolute scarcity guarantees of bitcoin creates this feedback loop of bitcoin holder zealotry which in turn makes the asset even more scarce. We’ve recently hit an all time high in long term holder supply, with the vast majority of bitcoin locked up in cold storage.

> I got a call [from billionaire hedge fund manager] Paul Jones and he says, “do you know that when bitcoin went from $17,000 to $3,000 that 86% of the people that owned it at $17,000, never sold it?” This was huge in my mind. So here’s something with a finite supply and 86% of the owners are religious zealots.
> 
> Stanley Druckenmiller

Bitcoin’s number-go-up (NGU) technology is driven by its absolute scarcity and exponential demand. And its exponential demand is driven by its fixed supply assurances. That’s far from the only reason, but it can’t be understated just how impactful a liquid and mathematically certain scarce monetary asset will be to the global financial system. Combining the fact that bitcoin is unique, its brand is one of the most recognizable in the world, and its adoption rate growing faster than the internet, its not long before bitcoin is impossible to ignore.

Bitcoin has no competition. No other money could ever match bitcoin’s level of scarcity. Its absolute scarcity will pull in value from all other store of value assets.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_5027-1024x573.jpg)

Money is a winner take all system, where the fewer monies to exchange is always preferred. And of course society will also have the incentive to adopt a good money over a bad ones. Government fiat currencies have failed over and over again over the course of hundreds of years, with the current epoch only existing for 50 years, a relatively short term economic experiment. They are prone to unsustainable leverage and inflation. Nation states have shown time and time again that they will always sacrifice monetary sustainability with short term political gain. This has ensured that government monies will always diminish in value over time.

Cryptocurrencies too don’t offer the same hard money assurances that bitcoin offers. The alternative future use cases for these cryptographic ledger technologies are vast and will be tested, however the use case for a superior money is by far the most disruptive on a global scale.

Absolute scarcity is a very layered phenomena that isn’t widely understood to date, and one which is very underestimated. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. That means there isn’t enough for each millionaire in the world to own a single bitcoin.

> It is very hard to predict the impact bitcoin will have on the $10 trillion gold market, the $20 trillion art and collectibles market, the $100 trillion stock market, the $225 trillion real estate market and the $250 trillion bond market.
> 
> Alex Gladstein

Unlike gold or any money that came before it, because bitcoin is infinitely divisible it can store all of the value of the solar system, and still function as a liquid money, even with its supply cap.

It’s also important to note that prices are set by marginal sellers and buyers. One dollar into bitcoin doesn’t equal one dollar rise in price. As the price increases, if there are fewer and fewer people who would want to part with their bitcoin due to its superior hardness as money, the rate at which the price increase could be exponential.

As adoption climbs towards critical mass, and as bitcoin is identified as the global money with the greatest relative scarcity, bitcoin will shift more and more from a store of value asset into a medium of exchange. Its price will stabilize in an ‘S’ curve adoption fashion as its used less as a savings vehicle and more for the purchase of goods and services. This will cause the price to become moderately deflationary, matching the growth rate of the economy at large.

# The Trust Machine

[November 11, 2022](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-trust-machine/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

> Bitcoin is a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust
> 
> Satoshi Nakamoto

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image.png)

## Why is Bitcoin Revolutionary?

Money at its core is a system of trust, a social construct if you will. But as we’ve seen time and time again, this trust has been betrayed.

In the wise words of Satoshi:

> The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.
> 
> Satoshi Nakamoto

The truth is, the trust in our global monetary system is broken. Wherever you look you’ll find a slow erosion of faith in our institutions.

But for good reason.

Scandals have plagued our financial institutions throughout our modern history. From inflation and fractional reserve bank runs, to the 2008 global financial crisis, to money laundering and straight up fraud.

Money is used by authoritarian regimes as a tool of control, oppressing billions of the poorest people on earth. Wealth is extracted from society through monetary debasement and interest rate manipulation, and concentrated in the hands of the well-connected. And debt slavery is systematically leveraged to social engineer a permanent working class.

Not only are the poor and middle class of the western world trapped in this hamster wheel, but also entire sovereign nations, through IMF structural adjustment loans and China’s Belt and Road initiative.

Unfortunately none of this is new. Throughout history, trust in money has been abused and manipulated, leading to breakdowns and inefficiencies in society.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/leban-300x295.jpg)

That’s where Bitcoin comes in.

Bitcoin is revolutionary because it’s a trust machine. Bitcoin manufactures trust because there are no humans that run it or rule over it. Instead you are trusting in math, physics, code, and probabilities.

Bitcoin’s trust is based on a globally decentralized network of tens of thousands of computers that maintain the integrity of the system. Bitcoin is the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth by many magnitudes. Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, a record that can’t be changed or destroyed and is constantly being audited. Bitcoin is money which is held in the most secure vaults in human history, money which can’t be controlled or debased, and money which can’t be unfairly counterfeited to insiders.

It’s kind of like putting a calculator in charge of a global financial and monetary system. A calculator that can’t be hacked and whose code is fully transparent, leading to a fully trustworthy and fully rules based economic system.

Unlike today’s currency which is maintained by banks, corporations, and governments, bitcoin is open source software, a banking system that is instead run on top of the internet.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Picture4.jpg)

Bitcoin is a global economic project maintained by developers all over the world, permissionlessly built on by entrepreneurs and academics, and run by human rights groups, democracy protesters and money nerds.

Because of this decentralization and immutability, bitcoin is incredibly secure and resistant to fraud and corruption. Unlike traditional banking, where a single point of failure can bring down the entire system, and where assets are actually just a chain of debt based liabilities, bitcoin’s distributed network is virtually invincible. Bitcoin is digital gold, a barer asset with no debt or counterparty risk.

Bitcoin is truth because all transactions are made without trust. All disputes are solved through physics and all ownership is enforced by cryptography. This is an automated justice system programmed into software, software that’s incorruptible, secure, and eternal.

_The entire point of bitcoin_ is to remove the distribution, production, and control over money from humanity. And the corruption that comes with it.

**This is trust in math, trust in code, not in humans.**

The trust machine is a revolutionary new technology that has the potential to completely upend our existing financial system.

> While traditional banking and payment systems heavily rely on trust, Bitcoin offers a way out of this system…Such a framework allowed the creation and implementation of a system effectively disjoined from government control, delivering a revolutionary separation of money and state for the first time in history.
> 
> Bitcoin Magazine

Bitcoin’s breakthrough was solving the byzantine generals problem, a computer science problem once thought impossible to solve. Satoshi discovered a way for people to coordinate with digital money without needing to trust each other. Instead of blindly believing the benevolence of third parties like banks or corporations, bitcoin manufactures truth through a global competition, leveraging the physical laws of nature and energy to keep the system incorruptible.

You can trust that bitcoin won’t cheat you, because bitcoin is code. Bitcoin’s neutrality as computer software means it holds no national, political or institutional allegiance. Bitcoin doesn’t know your economic status, age, religion, gender, ethnicity, or political views. Bitcoin doesn’t know who you are, or what you are. It doesn’t know if you’re a car, a refrigerator, or a drone. All it knows is code. It has simple rules. If you want to unlock the vault and send a unit of bitcoin, you have to provide the keys.

Bitcoin is a whole new monetary and financial system that’s based on uncontrollable money. The temptation of unlimited wealth has been taken away from human beings and because of that society will flourish.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Picture1.png)

## The Byzantine Generals Problem

How can I trust that when I send you a bitcoin, you won’t cheat me and just spend it twice? How can I trust that you will follow the rules? How can we both agree on how much bitcoin each of us owns? Information can just be copied over and over on the internet, in fact that’s the point.

> If you have an apple, and I have an apple, and we exchange apples, then you and I will still each have **one** apple.
> 
> But if you have an idea, and I have an idea, and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have **two** ideas.
> 
> George Bernard Shaw

In order to solve this problem, Satoshi had to invent digital scarcity. He had to put physics into the internet. She had to recreate the law of conservation of energy, within cyberspace.

To accomplish this task, he created a decentralized ledger, the first accounting innovation in over 700 years. Decentralized ledger just means that everyone is checking every transaction at all times, and everyone has access to the entire history of the ledger, for a fully transparent and fully secure money system.

And to secure this ledger, she had to program a global game theoretic competition, a lottery where players inadvertently help create a force field around the network, protecting it from bad actors.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image.png)

Bitcoin is special because this had never been done before, and has yet to be replicated since. Every other blockchain can be changed by some powerful special interests. Bitcoin is unique in the cryptocurrency space because it’s the only immutable unchanging immortal and invincible network in the world.

Therefore, bitcoin has value because you can guarantee transactions are legitimate. You can trust that the ledger isn’t fraudulent. You can trust that the money is really yours. You can verify for yourself that you are in possession, and that no one can change the rules. Bitcoin is property rights codified.

## Game Theory

A common motto of bitcoiners is “don’t trust, verify”. For the first time, we have a system of money where anyone can verify for themselves their money is real, and the rules of the monetary system are being followed. When it comes to money, people are incentivized to cheat. To take the easiest path possible. And for thousands of years humanity has faced this wealth confiscation dilemma, where we had to trust someone else with our savings.

When designing bitcoin Satoshi flipped the incentive structure on its head. Bitcoin ensures that everyone will follow the rules, because following the rules is what makes you the most money. Bitcoin was specifically designed with game theory to encourage fair play and participation, and make the cost to attack prohibitively expensive.

Bitcoin mining doesn’t just reward newly minted bitcoins, it creates a force field of computational power dedicated to supporting the honest chain of transactions. Fraudsters, hackers, sociopaths, and kings can’t change the rules, steal wealth, or cheat the system. In fact, they play along with the rest of us to acquire the soundest money in human history.

## The Golden Tablet

I think it’s helpful to picture bitcoin as “The great excel spreadsheet in the sky”. Think of it like the ultimate global google doc. It’s a shared spreadsheet in the cloud, freely accessible to anyone, and is just a long list of transactions. That’s literally all bitcoin is, it’s a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.

Ok that’s all well and good, but this great excel spreadsheet in the sky, why is that revolutionary?

Ok well let’s spice up the metaphor a bit – bitcoin is digital gold right? So instead of the excel sheet in the sky, think of it more like a golden tablet in the clouds, or on cyberspace mountain. This is some Moses shit. Carved into the enormous golden tablet is a list of all of the bitcoin in the world, who sent it to who and who owns it now.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_a_golden_tablet_that_looks_like_the_10_commandmen_259a15c5-2daf-450a-a920-cc56e6485f65-1024x1024.png)

Once you send some bitcoin to someone, a new line is magically carved into the tablet and it stays there forever. Anyone can see this golden tablet, it’s open and transparent and visible to all, but no one can undo transactions once they’re carved. No one can actually touch this tablet and no one can change the rules. It exists beyond the clutches of humanity. We’ve created something we can’t stop.

This is the trust machine.

You can trust bitcoin because it’s secured by math and by code. You can trust the golden tablet because it’s not controlled by humans. You can trust the trust machine because it exists beyond trust.

## Bitcoin is Physics in Cyberspace

Because the network exists beyond humanity, bitcoin can be compared to the unchanging and automatic laws of physics. This is the law of the conservation of energy written into computer software. When you send bitcoin to someone, it’s like physically handing them a piece of gold.

There is no third-party involved when you hand gold to someone. Gold is an element from nature, literally a rock, and physics governs the rules to hand a rock to someone else.

Bitcoin is the gold in this analogy, but it’s also the physics. Bitcoin is the money and the network. It’s both the matter and the gravity. bitcoin is the gold and Bitcoin facilitates the transfer.

Except of course this is all existing in cyberspace, a borderless and permissionless global network. A programmable and unstoppable money transfer protocol. The world’s most powerful supercomputer beaming value at the speed of light to anyone, anywhere, any time.

## Bitcoin is a Revolution

Bitcoin was designed to be simple, have no loopholes, be incredibly secure, and do one job and do it better than anything else. It doesn’t have any bells or whistles and it doesn’t try to be anything that it’s not. Bitcoin is sound money, the best money humanity has ever had.

> The purpose of bitcoin is to bring full sovereignty to the individual, and to remove all dependencies on trusted third parties. No rulers, no master, no hosts, only peers
> 
> GiGi

Bitcoin removes humans from the control over money, it obsoletes the entire existing global monetary framework, it replaces a system of money that is manipulated, debased, and untrustworthy, to one that you can trust. A system where the rules can’t be changed to benefit the rich and powerful. A system where no matter how much bitcoin you have, you can’t alter the tablet. THAT is monetary revolution.

# Designed Money

[April 26, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/they-invented-a-better-money-who-does-that/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Giancarnevale_a_hyper_realistic_photo_of_a_group_of_computer_sc_678df98a-91de-4af3-a728-7cfe7009dbb0.png)

All bitcoin is, is fake money. Why does it have any value at all?

Anyone can literally just make up their own money!

I could print a ton of monopoly dollars and start selling them to people saying something like, “trust me it’ll be really valuable someday!!!!”

But because the only thing you can do with bitcoin is trade it to someone else, how can you tell if it really does anything? It’s even not legal tender, you can’t really buy things with it.

And the greater idiot comes along someday and you can sell it to them, getting it off your hands and making a killing by being an early adopter 

Then these idiots are caught with the bag of fake coins, that don’t actually do anything, ha!

Jack has been sold a few “magic beans” for his cow.

You retail investors come along, paying all of this money for some collectable beanie baby, because someone else said it was “the new money of the world” or some bullshit, and you believed him!

## This is what everyone thinks the first time they learn about bitcoin

Or at least those late to the bitcoin party.

Not me of course, I first heard about bitcoin being used as money on the silk road to buy mushrooms. So my first impression was more like, “Oh yeah, _of course_ they invented a money for the internet, that makes sense” and I wasn’t very impressed.

My second exposure was from my anarchist roommate at summer camp who talked about it nonstop as a political tool. I was interested by what he had to say, but didn’t really think it would work. At the time, bitcoin had fallen from almost $1,000 all the way to $250 in Mt. Gox’s collapse, and I assumed it was a failed experiment.

I also saw liberty is losing all over the world and didn’t have much faith in an anarchist money to gain popularity for the masses. Lastly, I just wasn’t interested in monetary policy compared to other political issues.

But this is why this “magic beans” argument confused me for a long time, I never thought of bitcoin as an investment or something that would ever go up in price. I thought of it as a volatile money that probably was too niche to take off.

So for those who can’t see the utility right away, I understand why it’s important to dispel this ‘magic beans’ myth. You probably don’t have the same historical context as I do.

Not only do I understand pushback on bitcoin, but deep down I do respect it.

The bitcoin mantra is – don’t trust, verify. Ironically this keeps healthy skeptics (like me) away from studying bitcoin for some time.

I also understand that it’s vital you don’t blindly trust me or anyone in the bitcoin space, but take the time to verify and cross check many sources. It’s recommended that you remain cautious especially with crypto. There’s so many scams out there, and now there are so many coins and marketing ploys, it’s really difficult to understand what’s going on.

Asking if bitcoin actually does anything is totally a legitimate question.

The answer however, might make you go mad.

## Bitcoin is Designed Money

Bitcoin is like the manhattan project, it’s a huge research and development undertaking 40 years in the making, and isn’t even close to being finished.

One of the most surprising things for me personally was to learn that there had been many failed attempts at creating digital cash.

- 1989 digicash
- 1994 cybercash
- 1996 egold 
- 1997 hashcash 
- 1998 bit gold 
- 1998 again b-money
- 2004 RPOW

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1024x650.png)

The invention of bitcoin was truly revolutionary, but it built on the backs of great computer scientists and cryptographers.

> Can a “digital coin” be made? The answer appears to be “no”…bits can always be duplicated…so must look elsewhere.
> 
> The Cyphernomicon – Timothy C. May September 10, 1994

it was thought to be impossible to create a money in cyberspace not physically tied to the real world. The original interpretation of ecash was private digital abstractions of physical assets in physical places.

> Digital cash is not necessarily a form of _currency_, but is instead a transfer mechanism. More like a “digital check,”… I advise that people not worry overly much about the true and deep nature of money, and instead think about digital cash as a transfer protocol for some underlyng form of money, which might be gold coins, or Swiss francs, or chickens, or even giant stone wheels. 

They cypherpunks deeply researched into the legal issues with digital cash, the challenges with double spending, banking regulations, alternative currencies acceptability, etc. and decided that

Before satoshi solved double spend, the cypherpunks literally thought a native digital token couldn’t work.

The creators of bitcoin called themselves cypherpunks. The cypherpunks were a group of mega nerds, all around the world, who communicated via mailing lists and early internet messaging systems in the 90’s. They were techno-libertarians, fans of literature like 1984 and Atlas Shrugged. They were interested in all kinds of privacy preserving technologies, leveraging cryptography to secure freedom in the digital age.

They saw the writing on the wall, and were politically motivated to build freedom technology to combat the inevitable leeching of authoritarianism into cyberspace. The cypherpunks knew “If it’s to be it’s up to me” and were dedicated to _action_ to achieve their goals. The phrase “Cypherpunks write code” in Eric Hughes’s cypherpunk manifesto is their call to action, to apply cryptography and invent technology that preemptively preserves human rights, without asking for permission.

They were working on digital cash for a long time, from David Chaum’s eCash proposal in 1982, through the 90’s and 2000’s until bitcoin was finally released in 2008. The understanding at the time was that preventing copying and duplication of money in cyberspace was impossible, and private eCash could only be possible with a trusted bank or intermediary storing real world assets.

After multiple failures like Liberty Reserve it became apparent that centralizing any aspect of ecash would lead to it’s appropriation by state and authoritarian entities.

Every money throughout history has been subject to human control, manipulation, corruption, and inflation. Even gold and silver have been exploited throughout history, with dictators’ stamped faces into coins.

The designers of bitcoin were experts in distributed systems engineering and economic history,

They solved theses problem, combining 150 years of Austrian economic knowledge and Ancient Greek monetary theory to develop…

The perfect money.

## They Invented a Better Money (who does that??)

Bitcoin is the invention of a new digital money, it solves a decades old computer science dilemma, and is the invention of digital scarcity

Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat. If you look at all the attributes of a good money, bitcoin is superior in every way

The cyhpherpunks were experts on monetary history and knew all too well that the problems of unbacked fiat currencies create. Bitcoin was designed specifically to fix all of the shortcomings of gold which lead to it being obsolete as global money. Bitcoin is the hardest, soundest, and most perfect money ever developed by mankind

- Bitcoin isn’t just money, it’s isn’t just a digital asset, it’s also a network
- It’s an internet protocol, and a technology stack
- it’s a global monetary system and a global financial system

## So What is Bitcoin’s Intrinsic Value?

It doesn’t actually do anything, it’s just internet points. We have credit cards, paypal, venmo, cashapp, kohls cash, heck you can even send money over facebook messenger!

Once you learn what bitcoin is, who made it and why, you’ll see how this argument completely falls apart.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lebanon.png)

The reason Americans and those in the privileged western economic zones don’t understand bitcoin is because we don’t need to understand bitcoin.

Our financial system is, mostly, inclusive.

Our institutions are the best in the world, and while they definitely aren’t perfect, they’re good enough to where we don’t really pay attention.

Our financial privilege blinds us to the very real and very terrible struggles for BILLIONS of people around the world.

The difference between bitcoin and all other digital monies is that bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no one is in control.

In fact, bitcoin runs on it’s own without any human in charge. Bitcoin is like putting a calculator in charge of a global monetary and financial system, one that is rules based and unchanging.

> Bitcoin’s utility is that it allows people to store value outside of any currency system in something with provably scarce units, and to transport that value around the world.

No one can change the rules or devalue the currency. No one can enrich themselves by slowly stealing value from everyone else.

It’s a money that can’t be corrupted by humans because no human is in control of it

Solving the concentrated-benefits and dispersed-costs problem affecting all other fiat monies, aka inflation.

Bitcoin is the most neutral and fair money ever invented, and the consequences are profound.

## What is Bitcoin Backed by?

Bitcoin is backed by the only thing that backs any form of money: the credibility of its monetary properties.

Bitcoin was designed from the ground up to have the strongest monetary properties of any asset in history.

It solves the shortcomings of gold and fulfils the fundamental properties of money better than fiat.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png)

Fidelity’s digital asset arm produced a great report on Bitcoin’s monetary properties and why they are superior to all historical forms of money. This chart explains why bitcoin has value, you have to judge monetary goods on these monetary properties

Some of these monetary attributes were described thousands of years ago by Aristotle and they still hold true to this day.

The idea that money has to be backed by some other arbitrary thing that it does, is ridiculous because being a good money is already one of the hardest things in economic society to accomplish. It’s an insanely difficult task, that’s why there are so few things that actually manage to pull it off.

- Bitcoin is the first accounting innovation in over 700 years
- The last time there was any big revelation in bookkeeping was double booking accounting, popularized by the Medici and Florentine banking families, setting off an explosion of wealth and the renaissance
- Bitcoin is the invention of the decentralized ledger, of full accounting transparency, and of digital scarcity, which in our internet age will also result in a similar explosion of prosperity

One of the very few topics that all economists actually agree on is that price controls are stupid. It leads to shortages and misallocated resources EVERY TIME ITS TRIED there are thousands of examples. Thousands.

AND YET for some reason, everyone thinks the most important financial asset in the global financial system, money, should be managed by the state and corporations.

Do you really want the bankers manipulating the price of money, AKA the price of time for every human on earth…

AND YET no one stops to think that MAYBE price controls on money, maybe just maybe, are AS ineffective as price controls on everything else that they’re tried on.

All of our money is controlled by the state. And you better believe they manipulate and weaponize it, corrupt it and give hand outs to the elite and well connected. False price signals in interest rates cause the boom and bust cycles of our economy and the buildup of unsustainable debt.

Bitcoin is about more than just being the best money ever made, it’s a protest against the socialism that exists at the heart of our global financial system.

*****I have to spend some time her talking about WHAT IS MONEY and why it’s important, then go into how Bitcoin is better money

It is also worth noting that just like other monetary goods, bitcoin is not a company, it doesn’t pay a dividend or have cash flows. Therefore, its value must be derived from its ability to better fulfill the characteristics of a monetary good compared to traditional alternatives.

With a digital asset like bitcoin, it doesn’t require the use of a payment processor, a bank, or a government to transfer value. For large purchases, instead of using a bank as a middleman and paying its fees, you can securely send funds to anyone all over the world, like you would an email.

It enables cryptographically secure, censorship resistant payments across borders. It is the first and only form of absolute digital scarcity and is not controlled by any one person or group. As a result it cannot be interfered with by any world government.

From <[https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/common/](https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/common/)>

- Bitcoin was created by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto

- Bitcoin is the introduction of a totally neutral, independent money to the world economic stage, right now it’s small but in the coming years it will be a major world player. What does that look like when you have all inflationary global fiat monies and this one super sound deflationary money that financially incentivizes savings? The black hole of a perfectly scarce monetary good will absorb value as it gets built out.
- You don’t understand…they’ve created the hardest money of all time….hard money is always superior to soft money, over time there’s no escaping the incentives.  Bitcoin isn’t an if but a when…

# Bitcoin is Unparalleled

[November 22, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/unparalleled-new/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

## Bitcoin is One-of-a-kind and Has No competition.

There are no competitors in it’s quest for digital gold.

Bitcoin is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency that has no competition in the digital currency space. Despite the emergence of other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most popular and widely adopted digital currency in the world. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including Bitcoin’s network effect, superior monetary policy, and decentralized architecture, which make it an unbeatable force in the cryptocurrency market.

One of the biggest debates in the cryptocurrency space is between Eth killers and btc killers. Eth killers, such as Cardano and Solana, seek to replace Ethereum as the go-to platform for decentralized applications, while btc killers, such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, aim to dethrone Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency. However, despite the emergence of these projects, Bitcoin’s dominance remains unchallenged. This is because Bitcoin has been the number one cryptocurrency since its inception, and since the ICO failures of 2017, no one has been able to compete with its network effect.

Since the initial coin offering (ICO) failures of 2017, no cryptocurrency has emerged that can compete with Bitcoin’s network effect. The network effect is a phenomenon where a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. Bitcoin’s network effect is strong, and it has become a “if you can’t beat them, join them” situation for many cryptocurrencies. Instead of trying to compete with Bitcoin, many new cryptocurrencies are built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain, using it as a foundation.

Bitcoin is less like Myspace or AOL, and more like the internet itself, but for money. A base layer value transfer protocol, like TCP/IP. While other cryptocurrencies come and go, Bitcoin remains the most stable and secure digital currency in the market. This is because Bitcoin has a decentralized architecture that makes it impossible to manipulate or control. Additionally, Bitcoin’s network effect is too strong for any other cryptocurrency to challenge.

Anyone who is in crypto knows that Bitcoin is one of a kind. Sure, there are stablecoins for less volatility, and faster transaction coins for a better medium of exchange, but these aren’t trying to compete. They have different value propositions. Other cryptocurrencies are PoS or straight up scams, and they aren’t even trying to compete with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the money.

Bitcoin’s competition is actual gold, fiat currencies, and CBDC’s, all of which are flawed. While gold has been used as a store of value for centuries, it is not easily transferable or divisible. Fiat currencies are subject to inflation and government manipulation, and CBDC’s are centralized and subject to government control. The world would prefer neutral Bitcoin to Chinese CBDC Yuan.

One of the biggest reasons why Bitcoin has no competition is that any improvement in one characteristic of Bitcoin, such as improving its speed or scalability, leads to a reduction in another characteristic, such as Bitcoin’s level of decentralization or security. This tradeoff is known as the blockchain trilemma, and it is something that has yet to be overcome by any other cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin has the highest liquidity of all cryptocurrencies, meaning that it is the easiest cryptocurrency to buy and sell. Additionally, Bitcoin has the greatest number of users amongst all cryptocurrencies, giving it the largest network effects. This means that as more people adopt Bitcoin, its value will continue to increase.

Unlike every other cryptocurrency, there is no central point of failure with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has no Vitalik Buterin, no Ethereum Foundation, no Deltec bank like Tether, no fancy offices in San Francisco, no team of lawyers, no governance token, no VC-backing, no pre-mine, no small council, and no whales able to manipulate the system. This decentralized architecture has already insulated Bitcoin from attacks at the highest levels. No matter how much Bitcoin you own, you can’t change the rules, print more, censor, steal or prevent others from using the network.

Because of Bitcoin’s network effect, programmability, and superior monetary policy, direct alternatives have slowly faded away in importance. Bitcoin’s shortcomings have been accounted for within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as scalability lightning/liquid, privacy lighting/taproot, interoperability wallets/exchanges, and energy usage mining council/education. It’s now commonly understood that Bitcoin is built for one thing, incorruptible value storage, and other crypto projects have moved on to other use cases.

Bitcoin is often hailed as the king of cryptocurrencies, and there are several reasons why it is considered one-of-a-kind and without any competition. From its inception to its current status, Bitcoin has weathered many challenges, including the emergence of new cryptocurrencies and their potential to surpass Bitcoin’s dominance. However, Bitcoin has remained the undisputed champion of the cryptocurrency world. In this article, we will discuss why Bitcoin is one of a kind and doesn’t have any competition.

Different Value Propositions

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and is built for one thing: incorruptible value storage. Other cryptocurrencies have different value propositions, such as faster transactions or more stable prices. However, these cryptocurrencies are not trying to compete with Bitcoin; they are offering different solutions to different problems. For example, stablecoins offer less volatility, and faster transaction coins offer a better medium of exchange.

Other Cryptocurrencies are PoS or Straight Up Scams

Many new cryptocurrencies claim to have improved on Bitcoin’s design by using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism instead of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. However, PoS is untested at scale, and it is unclear whether it can provide the same level of security as PoW. Additionally, many new cryptocurrencies are straight up scams, preying on people’s FOMO (fear of missing out) and taking their money without delivering any real value.

Bitcoin’s Competition is Actual Gold, Fiat Currencies, and CBDCs

Bitcoin’s competition is not other cryptocurrencies but actual gold, fiat currencies, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years, but it has several limitations, such as storage and transport costs. Fiat currencies are subject to inflation and government manipulation. CBDCs are a new form of digital currency that is controlled by central banks, and their effectiveness is still untested.

The World Would Prefer Neutral Bitcoin to Chinese CBDC Yuan

CBDCs are a new form of digital currency that is controlled by central banks. China’s digital yuan is the most advanced CBDC, and it has raised concerns about the government’s ability to monitor transactions and control the economy. Bitcoin, on

n. Bitcoin is the most secure and immutable blockchain in existence. Its proof-of-work consensus mechanism has been battle-tested for over a decade and has proven to be incredibly resilient against attacks. In contrast, many other blockchain projects use untested or experimental consensus mechanisms that are prone to vulnerabilities and exploits.

o. Bitcoin has the largest developer ecosystem of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of developers working on its core protocol and a vast array of third-party applications and services being built on top of it. This ensures that the Bitcoin network will continue to evolve and improve over time.

p. Bitcoin has the potential to become a global reserve currency, much like gold was in the past. It’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies that are subject to inflation and political interference.

q. Bitcoin is the most widely recognized and accepted cryptocurrency, with a growing number of merchants and businesses accepting it as a form of payment. This trend is likely to continue as more people become familiar with Bitcoin and its benefits.

r. Bitcoin’s open and transparent ledger provides unprecedented levels of accountability and auditability, making it an ideal platform for businesses and governments to conduct transactions and manage their finances.

s. Bitcoin is a truly global currency, with no barriers to entry or restrictions on who can use it. This makes it an ideal platform for cross-border transactions and international trade.

t. Bitcoin has a passionate and dedicated community of users and supporters who are committed to its long-term success. This community provides a valuable source of support, development, and innovation for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

o. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it a deflationary asset. This is in contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks, leading to inflation and a loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin’s fixed supply, combined with its increasing demand, has led to a significant increase in its price over time.

p. Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate asset by institutional investors. In recent years, large financial institutions such as Fidelity, BlackRock, and JP Morgan have entered the Bitcoin market, providing institutional-grade custody and trading services to their clients. This has led to a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, and has helped to solidify its status as a legitimate asset class.

q. Bitcoin has a global reach, with users and nodes distributed all over the world. This means that Bitcoin is not subject to the whims of any single government or jurisdiction, and is truly a global currency. This makes it particularly attractive to people in countries with unstable or oppressive governments, who may not have access to traditional banking services.

r. Bitcoin is becoming more user-friendly over time. While it was once difficult for the average person to buy and use Bitcoin, this is no longer the case. There are now numerous exchanges and wallets that make it easy to buy, sell, and store Bitcoin, and there are even Bitcoin debit cards that allow users to spend their Bitcoin at merchants that don’t yet accept it directly.

# The Mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto

[October 31, 2022](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-mystery-of-satoshi-nakamoto/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

_The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto is not a story the Sith would tell you_

_And yet it is one of the most fascinating legends ever told_

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/satoshi-mystery4.jpg)

It’s the story of a cryptic computer scientist, an unknown person or a group of people whose invention has changed human civilization forever.

Unlike many legends of past, this story takes place in the modern, digital age, where everything is tracked and logged. Satoshi’s communications are publicly available to read, and yet the details around her identity are still shrouded in mystery.

_Let’s turn back the clocks to the year 2008_

In the midst of a global financial crisis, the worst economic emergency since the great depression, and *almost* the most cataclysmic economic event in the history of mankind…

A shadowy figure quietly emerges

They call them-self Satoshi Nakamoto

To calm markets and suppress a meltdown, emergency measures are taken by world governments, flooding the economy to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.

Our political and economic leaders barely save us from catastrophe, as the entire world is thrust into recession. Global debt reaches record levels, with the consequences merely postponed…

_The date is October 31st_

On a Halloween night, against the backdrop of this global crisis, this mad computer scientist quietly published the instructions to a new kind of money. A digital money, an unstoppable money, ruled by no human being. An invention they call bitcoin.

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
> 
> Satoshi Nakamoto

In a time where overleveraged financial institutions had risked the solvency of the global economy, the seeds of rebellion were planted. A revolutionary new economic system was born.

For you see, this unknown inventor of bitcoin, was a Cypherpunk

The Cypherpunks were a group of rogue anti-authoritarian computer programmers, digital liberty advocates and anarchists. Computer scientists who were terrified of a future Orwellian surveillance state.

They decided to take freedom into their own hands, creating technology no government or corporation could stop.

And independent money was their holy grail.

The Cypherpunks had been diligently working towards the perfect digital money for decades. Their aim was to free humanity from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and to move money privately, without permission, and without censorship. The separation of money and state.

Standing on the shoulders of the Cypherpunk giants, Satoshi had a breakthrough.

No one ever meets this person. No one even knows if they are a single person or a group. No one ever hears her voice and no one ever sees his face.

That’s because there’s no one actually named Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s a pseudonym, a disguise, a mask.

Like a real life superhero, they conceal their identity from the world. All communication was done digitally through forum posts and email. Through meticulous planning, evasive linguistic tactics, and unpredictable posting times, Satoshi left no traceable personal clues in their writing.

In their whitepaper published on that fateful Halloween, Satoshi presents a solution to a computer science dilemma, a problem once thought impossible to solve.

Simultaneously reinventing one of the oldest technologies in human civilization, and solving a multi-thousand-year-old trust problem, with the first accounting innovation in over 700 years, Satoshi created a trust machine that runs on its own without human involvement. Eliminating the need to trust in institutions like banks, corporations or governments.

Satoshi discovered a way to put physics into the internet, to recreate the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy, within cyberspace. Satoshi discovered a new form of time, a decentralized clock, that ticks for eternity. Satoshi discovered a way to give everyone on earth access to immutable money, a revolution in property rights.

Her invention has profound consequences for the history of mankind. Completely altering our relationship with technology and the future of the internet.

For a couple of years, this mysterious computer scientist worked with volunteers to bootstrap the project. Fixing bugs and tweaking the code. And then suddenly…disappears. Like a ghost.

It’s a departure without a display. She simply leaves. They stop answering questions and emails, and he stops participating in discussions.

No one ever finds out who they are, where they came from or where they went. Satoshi remains unknown to this very day.

But with its creator gone, what is to become of this digital money project? Does it fade away into obscurity?

Quite the opposite, bitcoin jolts to life, its thunder is heard around the world.

Bitcoin went on to become the fastest trillion dollar valuation of any asset in history, at an adoption pace faster than the internet itself. Spawning an entirely new asset class and industry, and tens of thousands of other projects.

The invention of bitcoin marked a fundamental breakthrough in computer science, information theory, economics, fintech and cryptographic systems.

Now the largest supercomputer on earth, bitcoin is completely immortal. It can’t be shut down, it can’t be hacked, it can’t be banned, it can’t be changed, and it can’t be controlled. Even the most powerful governments, corporations and institutions in the world are powerless to stop it.

It is a self-running software program designed to last forever.

No one knows how it’s possible for Satoshi to both solve this unsolvable computer science problem and build an all-powerful, self-sustaining monetary system at the same time.

To be a polymath, specialized across multiple academic disciplines, and yet evade detection. The field of experts in distributed systems engineering is so small you would think it would be simple to nail them down, and yet there have been no definitive leads.

Is Satoshi an alien? A time traveler? A secret government organization? A libertarian nerd in his mother’s basement? It’s very possible that Satoshi isn’t even alive anymore. It’s been well over a decade and still no one can unmask her Halloween disguise.

By disappearing Satoshi left behind ultimate fame, power, and fortune. Adding to the mystery.

It’s estimated that Satoshi is in direct control of over _one million bitcoins_, and yet the coins have never been touched. Satoshi can anonymously move or sell their bitcoin whenever they want.

The fact that this treasure has sat dormant since 2010 leads many to believe that it’s unlikely Satoshi is ever coming back. If someone had access to that kind of money, they probably would have used some of it by now.

Instead, Satoshi’s treasure sits untouched as a monument to their selflessness.

Satoshi’s treasure is becoming the largest pile of money in history. In only a few years Satoshi is expected to be the richest person in the world, as the value of their fortune surpasses $300 billion. It’s predicted that this treasure surpasses a trillion dollars in value as soon as the 2030’s.

Because bitcoin’s blockchain is completely transparent, the wallets that hold Satoshi’s treasure are publically available for all to see, and yet remain completely untouchable. To compute even one of Satoshi’s keys would take until the heat death of the universe.

Satoshi’s treasure lies there mocking the old guard of money, the financial institutions he so adamantly dismayed. It lies there as a testament to the power of the individual, proving that anything is possible. And it lies there taunting those who are driven by greed, selfish minds who only seek out fortune and fame, proving that humans are capable of throwing it all away for the good of humanity.

It lies there forever jeering: “Here lies Satoshi’s legendary treasure — take it, if you can”

…

For many years to come, the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto will continue to incite awe and astonishment as people first learn about bitcoin’s humble origins. People from around the world will marvel at the genius of Satoshi and speculate on their identity and motivation. Classes will be taught on bitcoin and the chapter dedicated to Satoshi will inspire generation after generation.

We will probably never know who invented bitcoin. The moral of the story isn’t to speculate on who Satoshi is, but to understand that it doesn’t matter. 

Satoshi gave bitcoin as a gift to humanity. We run bitcoin and we decide it’s future. There’s no one in charge now, bitcoin belongs to everyone. We are all equal participants in the network.

We are all Satoshi

On a Halloween night, 15 years ago

An anonymous and mysterious programmer, posted the solution to a computer science problem.

A problem once thought impossible to solve.

It was the invention of an all-powerful, uncontrollable, malware network.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Giancarnevale_an_all_powerful_malware_network_d6a8ca67-3e95-42ca-a875-0ff8ce5a979f-1024x1024.png)

October 31st 2008 will go down in history as the day Pandora’s box was opened

…when an _irreversible curse_ was cast on humanity…

As it turns out, this digital invention was _actually_ an unstoppable computer cancer

Set loose into cyberspace!

…and now…

…14 years later…

…it has spread to the point of no return.

_What’s even more scary is –_

_This shadowy mastermind…this mad computer scientist_…

V_anished._

_Like a ghost._

_And remains unknown to this very day_.

No one even knows if he is dead or alive, and yet, this invention has made her worth of over $30 billion.

In fact, she is projected to be the richest human on earth in less than 5 years.

And their invention has changed the course of human civilization forever.

This is a Halloween story scarier than any other.

Because this story,

Is real.

The invention I was talking about ^

Well you _probably_ know it best as “digital gold”

but isn’t gold at all…

In fact Bitcoin is actually orange

_Like the color palate from the holiday in which it spawned…this Halloween nightmare has quite the interesting story …._

For you see, the unknown inventor of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, was a Cypherpunk

The Cypherpunks were a group of rogue anti-authoritarian computer programmers.

Digital liberty advocates and anarchists.

_More like a A bunch of nerds_! (back in the 90s) who were terrified of a future Orwellian surveillance state.

They decided to take freedom into their own hands.

Creating technology that no government or corporation could stop!

Bitcoin is the result of decades of research and development by the cypherpunks.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/prehistory-1-1024x712.png)

It is a fundamental breakthrough in computer science, information theory, fintech, economics, and cryptographic systems.

And it obsoletes our man made monetary institutions, like banks, corporations, and governments.

This is trust in math, trust in code, not in humans.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Giancarnevale_an_untrolable_and_digital_monetary_network_looks__c01d8bd1-d60c-45a9-81fd-936fd2b2bc5c-1024x1024.png)

Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency for a reason, it’s the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth.

Bitcoin is immortal. It can’t be shut down, it can’t be banned, it can’t be hacked, it can’t be changed, and it can’t be controlled.

Bitcoin runs on its own without anyone in charge.

It’s a money that’s out of control.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Giancarnevale_scary_bitcoin_a91b61a6-a924-47ce-9ca7-8fe2ecccdfda-1024x1024.png)

It’s a virus that hijacks human greed,

A contagion that make its hosts filthy rich

Using game theory to infect the world with money beyond our control.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Giancarnevale_a_hooded_figure_sitting_in_a_chair_by_a_computer__fb387c46-e32e-42a3-ac5e-bf3e0f2b64b1-1024x1024.png)

You might be wondering, what’s the point, why was bitcoin created? what’s the end game?

The cypherpunks designed bitcoin to end humanity’s monopoly on money.

And the corruption that comes with it.

Bitcoin is the separation of money and state.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cypher-1.jpg)

Everyone intuitively understands that it’s all about the money. Always has been.

Imagine the most powerful tool of civilization, pried from the clutches of the elite.

Infected, outwitted, and unseated.

Bitcoin is just getting started.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7xin99-1024x575.jpg)

If you don’t remember anything else about bitcoin, just remember this: No one controls bitcoin, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it.

On that fateful Halloween night, human civilization was changed forever.

Grab your popcorn, cus the next 20 years are going to be fucking wild!




# The Trust Machine [speech]

[June 21, 2025](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-trust-machine-speech/)[thebitcoinbreakdown](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)

Ok to kick off this talk, I’m going to need everyone to take out some cash, a $1 bill, $20 and if you don’t haven’t any please just share with your neighbor

(Wait a few seconds)

Ok if someone would be so kind to let me borrow a bill just a few seconds for this demonstration

(Wait a few seconds) (put it in pocket)

Ok all kidding aside, please flip it over and take a look at the back

(I take out a bill and hold it up) 

Printed on every dollar bill is the phrase “In god we trust”, and yet, we don’t trust god with our money, we put trust in humans, who have corrupted our monetary systems time and time again.

You see, when it comes to money, humans are incentivized to cheat

Go figure,

We trust humans to safeguard money, to mint coins, and to run our economy, but that system is ripe for corruption.

And what sucks is we HAVE to trust in humans. We can’t give the job to donkeys.

If we don’t have people to safeguard our money than other humans will just steal it. It’s a dilemma as old as time.

A dilemma Ive so aptly named “The trusting humans with money problem”

Not because humans are naturally bad or evil —  It’s incentives and game theory

History has shown that if the money is centralized into the hands of humans, it can and will be corrupted, no matter how many checks and balances, and layers of democracy you put over it

As the saying goes, Power corrupts and absolute power prints money

Why is this a problem?

Money is the bedrock of civilization, just like language, 

Which is a big problem if humans are incentivized to corrupt it

Imagine if the english language could be used to steal from you, control you, or enslave you.  

Well money is, all the time.

Money is used by authoritarian regimes as a tool of control, oppressing billions of the poorest people on earth. 

Wealth is extracted from society and concentrated in the hands of the well-connected elites.

And debt slavery is systemically leveraged to socially engineer a permanent working class.

And most sinister of all,

Rich countries exploit the global south through structural adjustment loans, also known as debt colonialism, 

Impoverishing, endangering and killing millions of people; 

enriching dictators and kleptocrats 

and causing trillions of dollars of food, natural resources and cheap labor to flow from poor to rich nations annually, benefiting former colonial powers and multinational corporations.

Unfortunately none of this is new. Throughout history, trust in money has been abused and manipulated, leading to breakdowns and inefficiencies in society.

But what if I told you there was a way to Trust god with our money? 

Or a god-like computer algorithm

A trust…machine?

That’s where bitcoin comes in. 

Bitcoin is revolutionary because it is a trust machine. Bitcoin manufactures trust because it auto-magically runs itself.

Instead of humans you are trusting in math, physics, code, and probabilities.

Instead of debt slavery, bank bailouts, or inflation, you’re trusting software with an ethical monetary policy. 

I’m gonna do my best to break down the complexity of the trust machine so you can see why it’s so revolutionary.

Because if we can’t trust god with money, a trust machine is our only hope.

Ok quick recap, It’s simple, humans can’t be trusted to maintain a currency so we turned towards computers and technology.

You see, by separating money from human decision making, you’ve effectively solved a problem as old as civilization itself   
  
Unlike today’s currency which is maintained by banks, corporations, and governments, bitcoin is open source software, a monetary system that is instead run on top of the internet.  
 

This is so much more than a digital coin

This is an automated justice system programmed into software, software that’s incorruptible, secure, and eternal. Software that no human can change.

No dictator, no king, no president, no CEO, no billionaire, no illuminati,

This is the trust machine.

For the first time in history we have a money that can’t be used to steal from us, a money that can’t be used to control us, A fair, ethical and trustworthy way to organize society.

Bitcoin is revolutionary because this had never been done before, and has yet to be replicated since. Every other money, blockchain, or crypto can be changed by some powerful special interests, and therefore isn’t a trust machine. 

 In conclusion, 

Money is used as an instrument of power to control all of us and to create wars and kill people

Bitcoin removes humans from the control over money, solving the “Trusting humans with money problem”

Replacing a system that is manipulated, debased and untrustworthy to one that you can trust. 

A system where the rules can’t be changed to benefit the rich and powerful. 

Our leaders proclaim “in god we trust!”

Our rulers proclaim, “you can trust in us”

Bitcoin doesn’t proclaim, 

it executes

No Leaders. 

No Rulers. 

In Code We Trust.
