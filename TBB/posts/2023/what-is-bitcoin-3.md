Bitcoin is the next evolution in money. It’s a 21st century monetary technology that will outlast our fiat currency system. Bitcoin is money for a type one civilization.

Bitcoin is not just a currency, it is a complete reworking of our global monetary system.

It is the first digital system of money that is completely decentralized.

Decentralized means its spread out, it exists everywhere, and no one is in control. This is the biggest differentiator between bitcoin and everything else that has ever existed.

Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P transaction technology. It's Peer-to-peer because there's no one in the middle of the person you're transacting with. Bitcoin is self running computer code which facilitates transactions automatically. It's an independent third party software which holds no allegiances, and runs completely on its own.

So, what is bitcoin?

Bitcoin isn't just money. It isn't just a digital asset, and it isn't just software.

Bitcoin is a network, an internet protocol, and a technology stack.

It's layers upon layers of different apps, companies, software, hardware, networks, miners, implementations, alt-chains, smart contracts, decentralized protocols, services, tools and exchanges, which together form this unstoppable global public monetary infrastructure.

It's a publicly accessible global bank, global monetary system and global financial system.

The reason bitcoin is so revolutionary is because it's so unique. There's never been a money that's digital, programmable, finite and uncontrollable by humans. One which runs its own publicly available global monetary system outside of the purview of corrupt governments and corporations.

One which was engineered from the ground up to have all around superior monetary properties, and exist within an entire network of trust minimized protocols facilitating payments and contracts all open source, transparent, and available to all. No exceptions.
