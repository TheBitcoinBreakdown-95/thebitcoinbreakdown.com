Bitcoin is the Manhattan project for human freedom

It's an enormous, globally coordinated research and development initiative:

An open source software project aimed at building an unstoppable internet-native monetary system.

A tech stack - which implements fair, neutral money and protects human rights for 8 billion people.

Fighting back against authoritarianism and the encroachment of a digital Orwellian surveillance state.

There's a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize.
