Forget everything you know about bitcoin. Forget everything you know about blockchain, and crypto.

Once you begin this journey there's no going back. Those who venture down this path rarely return.

Once you understand bitcoin in all its complexity your life and your view of the world will change forever.

Be warned, there are more questions than answers that lie ahead of you.

If you've ever watched the show Lost, you know what it's like to be sucked down a path of endless questions and an unquenchable thirst to know where it all leads.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1.png)

I want to make an all encompassing introduction to people, about what bitcoin actually is.

I know how revolutionary bitcoin is, but it's a **really** tough subject to explain.

It took me a hundred hours to understand it, hundreds more just addressing my questions, and another few hundred after that trying to find the catch. I want to break it all down so you can understand in much less time than it took me haha. If I'm good at one thing its organizing knowledge.

There's a lot of misinformation and scammy shit out there, and there needs to be more honest and dependable voices in the space. I have no financial reason to do this, I'm just passionate.

I want you to know, I too was skeptical about bitcoin for many years, even after studying it for countless hours. It's very important that you learn about bitcoin in an adversarial way, don't believe anyone, and cross check many sources. This is a huge commitment but I can tell you it's worth it.

> Even after a couple of years exploring what is bitcoin you’ll find that you are still learning you’re still trying to understand what it is.
> 
> Andreas Antonopoulos

You should not be taking things at face value. Do not trust what you read without rationalizing it for yourself and always look for counter arguments. Read all the sources and then weigh each as unbiased as you can.

By being skeptical, it means you are a rational thinker and don't just blindly accept things as they are. Which is an integral part of bitcoin, and a foundational value of all bitcoiners.

We have a saying in bitcoin, don't trust, verify. I don't want you to trust what I'm telling you, I want you to be inspired to learn more and discover your own truth.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-2.png)

I knew about bitcoin for a long time, but in hindsight I didn't know anything.

I started off like everyone else, thinking it would either make me rich, or that it was cute nerd money that would just fade away someday…

Knowing about bitcoin, and realizing what bitcoin is, are two completely different things.

In bitcoin circles we call this phenomena falling down the rabbit hole. It’s the process of slowly realizing what bitcoin is and then spending months and months and hundreds of hours obsessively learning as much as you can.

My job is to make your fall down the rabbit hole as easy as possible, if you're curious.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rabbithole-1-300x290.png)

You're journey begins…with a simple question..

# What is bitcoin?

It's a question everyone asks but no one seems to have a good answer for.

John Oliver host of Last Week Tonight, said it best:

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-1024x807.png)

Usually, the nerds will give you the technical definition:

> *Bitcoin is an open monetary transmission protocol*...blah blah blah

They'll tell you what it does and how it works...but I heard these jargon filled definitions repeated for years and they never helped me, in fact they all made bitcoin seem boring and underwhelming.

Because of all of these boring definitions, Bitcoin is very misunderstood, I can tell you it's not what you think it is.

It's a totally new invention, revolutionary invention, and yet it's shrouded in complex terminologies and elitist jargon.

> *Wow what a difficult task you have. At a very basic level you have to try to understand what is bitcoin. I can answer that question in for words. Bitcoin is digital money. But that doesn’t really capture it. It’s more like the Internet of money. But really it’s a consensus decentralized network based on Blockchain technology and proof of work algorithm that allows a digital token to act as a reward system for a game theoretical competition between decentralize minors to validate...and oh my it immediately goes off a cliff....*
> 
> Andreas Antonopoulos

The only things we have to explain what bitcoin is, are analogies of already existing technologies. But like the old saying goes, some analogies are helpful, but all are wrong.

## Some of my personal favorite bitcoin analogies are:

-   Bitcoin is digital gold
-   Bitcoin is gold that you can send from one phone to another...or from one BRAIN to another.
-   Bitcoin is digital Super-Gold! Flying around the world at the speed of light, in an unstoppable PayPal
-   Bitcoin is not just a bank account, but a full Swiss bank in your pocket
-   Bitcoin is not just money on the internet, it's the "Internet of Money", a programmable monetary base layer internet protocol like TCP/IP or HTTP
-   Bitcoin is the world's largest, most secure, and most powerful supercomputer
-   Bitcoin is like putting a calculator in charge of a global monetary and financial system
-   Bitcoin is like beanie babies, except for ending human slavery
-   Bitcoin is a global anti-authoritarian political movement and a peaceful technological revolution
-   Bitcoins are "*magic internet tokens*" that you can store inside an app on a smart phone!!
    -   *Silly little made up internet points, that for some reason people pay tends of thousands of dollars for...*

Bitcoin is the Manhattan project for human freedom. An escape hatch from our monopolistic fiat-capitalist global economic system.

## My personal favorite analogy for explaining bitcoin goes a little like this:

Imagine there's this huge elephant, and a group of blind monks all walk up to it and start feeling it up to try and make sense of it.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-3-1024x742.png)

Right so one monk is petting it's head, another is on its back feeling it's ridged spine, there's a monk clinging to one of its tusks, one pulling on it's ears, another is tossing around it's testicles, and yet another is rubbing on its toes.

The elephant of course is bitcoin in this analogy, there's so many different pieces, it's impossible for any one of us (the blind monks) to get a sense of it fully.

What makes it even more difficult to explain to new people is that there is no good elevator pitch for bitcoin, it truly depends on where you're coming from, your prerequisite knowledge, and personal values.

> Ask three strangers what Bitcoin is, and you will probably get three very different answers. Any answer is necessarily shaped by past experience, political and economic beliefs, and an individual understanding of the world. Your personal set of ideas, your world view, defines where you are on the landscape of ideas.
> 
> Gigi

Explaining to the monk touching the elephant's tusks what the testicles feel like is totally a lost cause.

My job of course is to lead you little monks all around the elephant, feeling all the parts to get a sense of something totally new. This of course requires *a bit of commitment* from the student, however I can promise you that you will find it very rewarding if you stick around.

# What is bitcoin?

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-7-1024x683.png)

Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, it is the invention of digital scarcity i.e. digital property. It's a new form of money and an independent global monetary network. It was invented by a person or persons under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and is an enormous breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems.

In simple terms bitcoin is digital money.

But then again so are dollars, euros, and yen. We have PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Kohls cash, Credit Card reward points...heck you can even send money over Facebook messenger!

So while digital money is technically correct! It doesn't really tell us anything...

What about digital gold? I'm sure you've heard that term tossed around, and honestly I do like it a lot better.

If I was explaining bitcoin to a 5 year old I would say that bitcoin is just gold that's on the internet. In the same way that email is just internet mail, bitcoins are gold coins on the internet.

I like this comparison because calling bitcoin digital gold tells you it's one of a kind, rare, and desirable. However bitcoin is more than just digital gold, its an evolution of gold. Where gold is great at moving value across time, its not great at moving value across space.

Bitcoin is better than gold because it was specifically designed to fix all of its shortfalls. Including verifiability, portability, and divisibility.

But still this definition of "digital gold" is underwhelming. It is extremely simplified and doesn't really explain why bitcoin is so revolutionary.

To steal another line from Andreas Antonopoulos:

> Saying bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-4.png)

# What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the next evolution in money. It’s a 21st century monetary technology that will outlast our fiat currency system. Bitcoin is money for a type one civilization.

Another analogy I like to us is:

## The Great Excel Spreadsheet in the Sky

Think of it like an ultimate google doc, a shared spreadsheet in the cloud which is just a list of transactions. That's literally all bitcoin is, it's just a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.

At the most basic and fundamental level, bitcoin is just a ledger.

But instead of existing on the computers of banks, it exists on hundreds of thousands of computers all around the globe.

They all have the same ledger and everyone is in complete agreement with who sent money to who. 

If you're having trouble putting an image of bitcoin in your head just think of a long digital excel spreadsheet, a calculator that keeps track of everyone's money.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-5-1024x599.png)

So when people say, bitcoin isn’t real, it’s the same as saying your money in the bank isn’t real.

Except of course the bitcoin ledger is the most powerful and secure supercomputer on earth, can’t be hacked or shut down, and you have full autonomy over your savings.

When we're talking about digital dollars or Zuckerberg bucks, the money ledger is stored on a central server. Basically the bank has a private computer that they keep all the records of everyone's money.

The big difference is that Bitcoin's ledger is a decentralized server. It's hosted on tens of thousands of computers across the globe. Every bitcoin computer has a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain, for a fully transparent system. Bitcoin's ledger is everywhere, its in the cloud.

*It's the great excel spreadsheet in the sky.*

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-6-1024x541.png)

Bitcoin is like an unstoppable PayPal, beaming digital super-gold around the world at the speed of light. It allows you to send and receive value, to and from anyone in the world, with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection.

The software operates on it's own. All of bitcoins functions are facilitated by computer code. There's no customer service you can call, no corporation that can change the rules, and no government that can stop your payments.

And anyone can access it, no exceptions.

## Bitcoin is information

Because bitcoin is just an internet ledger, and there's no physical coins, bitcoin is pure information.

It's technically just 1's and 0's computer code, and cool math! There aren't even any coins, it's just a list of transactions and units.

> Bitcoin is a revolutionary asset class where value is represented not as a physical or digital object, but as a record of ownership on the Bitcoin blockchain.
> 
> Gemini Cryptopedia

You can send a bitcoin transaction via QR code...or in a picture. You can store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in your brain by memorizing 24 words.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_a_sloth_eating_an_ice_cream_cone_00dc77a9-6ea1-4a6b-878f-28892a4bf995-300x300.png)
*There are 233 bitcoins ($7,000,000) embedded in this image*

If you think about it from an adversarial perspective, this makes bitcoin extremely difficult to censor. You can send someone money with a meme!

You can text a bitcoin transaction with emojis, you can send it via satellite, you can send it over radio, you can save the file on an SD card, or mail it hidden in a love letter.

And once a bitcoin transaction is sent it can’t be undone.

Being digital also makes bitcoin extremely portable, frictionless, and easily integrated into our digital world.

Bitcoin is also programmable and can be designed around without permission. You can program money in countless of innovative ways with smart contracts and new complex financial infrastructure can be built on top of it.

Multi party custody solutions, payment channels, atomic swaps, batch transactions, time locks, vaults, prisms, micropayments, in-game currency integration, money streaming, insurance and options smart contracts, layer three web browsers, social networks, encrypted messaging.... and so much more that hasn't even been invented yet.

Also with bitcoin, robots, self-driving cars, drones, refrigerators, smart homes etc. can all hold and use bitcoin between themselves, a whole robot economy independent of ours.

This isn't possible within our current credit based monetary system, since that requires passing of personal information and creditworthiness, a regulatory and security nightmare. Bitcoin on the other hand can be settled instantly with cash finality, zapped around at the speed of light anywhere on earth.

# What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is not just a currency, it is a completely new technological innovation of money.

It is the first system of money that is completely decentralized.

Decentralized means its spread out, it exists everywhere, and no one is in control. This is the biggest differentiator between bitcoin and everything else that has ever existed.

Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P transaction technology. It's Peer-to-peer because there's no one in the middle of the person you're transacting with. Bitcoin is self running computer code which facilitates transaction automatically. It's an independent third party software which holds no allegiances, and runs completely on its own.

> Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system based on a distributed digital ledger called a blockchain or timechain. The ledger includes transactions approved by the peer-to-peer network instead of a central authority.
> 
> Bitcoin Magazine

Bitcoin is a broadcast network where *the message is the money*.

It's a broadcast network because transactions are sent to all computers in the network to be audited. It's basically a software program for sending and receiving text messages (transactions) of a new monetary unit called bitcoin.

But bitcoin isn't just money, it's isn't just a digital asset, and it's not just a software.

Bitcoin is a network. An internet protocol, and a technology stack. It's layers upon layers of different apps, software, hardware, networks, companies, services and tools, which together form unstoppable globally public monetary infrastructure. It's a global bank, a global monetary system and a global financial system.

Bitcoin is a reinvention of money itself.

## Bitcoin is a Network

Bitcoin is a global interconnected computer network made up of tens of thousands of nodes.

> A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected—either by cables (wired) or WiFi (wireless)—with the purpose of transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources. 
> 
> IBM

> A node is a connection point inside a network that can receive, send, create, or store data. A node is essentially \[a computer\] that can recognize, process, and transmit information to any other network node.
> 
> IBM

The nodes \[computers\] that make up the bitcoin network all run the same free open source software. This software is a language that allows these computers to interact with each other, and it governs the rules of the system.

Specifically, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, where every computer can communicate with any other computer directly. There's no central server processing all of the data, and every computer is the same in the eyes of the network. There are no hierarchies, there are no master nodes that have any more power than any other nodes. Peer-to-peer means that bitcoin has a flat topology, every node is equal.

The nodes constantly pass around verify transactions, and importantly, all of these computers have the same copy of the ledger. When someone makes a bitcoin transaction all computers in the network update their ledger together. Therefore bitcoin is on all of the computers in the network at the same time.

Because all nodes run the same software, all members of the network must adhere to the consensus rules and monetary policy in order to send and receive transactions. This makes it impossible for one single person or group to cheat the system or adjust the rules like they can with fiat money.

You can think of the bitcoin network kind of like a big mushroom, where there's not really a brain. It's all just one big blob. Or you could even think of Bitcoin as the brain itself, with electricity pulsing throughout the network to build one self-sufficient, autonomous, system.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Giancarnevale_a_golden_altgorithm_with_data_flows_computer_code_81d7b512-4231-41e8-b63e-30951471b354-768x768.png)
*Ai interpretation of a golden network*

And to confuse you even more, bitcoin is also the name of the software that the nodes are running on the network.

So to recap: bitcoin the currency, is sent over Bitcoin the network, by computers running Bitcoin the software.

## Bitcoin is Time

You can think of Bitcoin as a kind of clock, it keeps track of time across the tens of thousands of computers that make up its network. A decentralized clock if you will, keeping track of which transactions came first. Ticking away for eternity.

Not only does bitcoin tell time, but Bitcoin is an invention of a new kind of time. Blocktime.

Consider each new block added to the blockchain as a tick or a tock. The nodes within the bitcoin network come to a consensus of what the blocktime is and what transactions are included in each block.

Bitcoin facilitates this decentralized variable time in a trustless manner, i.e. there's no one 'keeping time' the computers do this algorithmically without interference.

Obviously the problem of timekeeping is a big deal when dealing with a ledger, the order of who sent money to who is extremely important. If someone has control over the order of transactions they can literally control who has what money.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-9-1024x553.png)

The fancy term for this is Bitcoin is a distributed timestamp server, mitigating disputes in the order of transactions, completely autonomously, through a complex interplay of physics and game theory.

Bitcoin is automatic and can’t be shut off. No one controls the bitcoin time chain, it's a computer system that exists beyond the control of humanity.

It exists as permanently and beyond human control as time itself.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-10-1024x441.png)

## Bitcoin is money

In order to understand what bitcoin is, you have to understand what money is.

Money is a technology to move value across space and time. Money stores your time and energy to be used at a different time.

For example you can build cabinets and trade that for a day at a spa.

Money allows for complex exchange, trade specialization, and lays the groundwork for advanced economies.

Money is one of the oldest inventions of civilization, it even predates writing. In fact the first forms of writing were credit spreadsheets, of who owed what to whom. Money was so important in society we had to invent writing to keep track of it! it's such a primal tool that we have even taught animals how to use it.

And it's so ubiquitous that many of us take it for granted. 

Money is by far the most important good in an economy. It's half of every single transaction. Not only is it extremely important on an individual level, but it’s one of the fundamental technologies in the development and sustainability of society itself.

Which is why bitcoin - a money that can't be diluted or counterfeited - is so transformative as a monetary technology.

![](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-11-1024x576.png)

There are two types of money - money can either be physical, like a coin, seashell, salt, cigarette, necklace bead, or paper bill. Or it can be a list of transactions and debts owed like a bank account, clay tablet, or credit card. 

On the internet, *money has to be information*, since it’s the informational realm, and therefore *money has to be a ledger*.

The very nature of information is that it can be copied indefinitely, and before bitcoin there was no way to limit someone from just counterfeiting digital money without repercussion.

Sure you could trust a 3rd party like a bank or a corporation to keep track of your digital money, but debasement/counterfeiting of money has always been commonplace...and it's the reason bitcoin was invented in the first place.

The true innovation of bitcoin was inventing a way for digital money from being spent twice in an automated system without human control. Replicating the scarce nature of physical matter within cyberspace.

## Bitcoin is digital money

Bitcoin is digital property

Programmable

-   One where you can build applications because it is programmable
-   One where you don't need permission to launch an application
-   Where there are no gate keepers or barriers to entry
-   Where ingenuity is financially incentivized, and an open market of ideas will flourish
-   Bitcoin is programmable money, with so many use cases we haven't even thought of yet, due to its open source, permissionless nature, it will inspire innovation at the edges and the free marketplace of ideas will flourish innovation

## bitcoin is designed money

Bitcoin isn’t just any money, it’s the best money ever made

It's sound money, it's powerful money, it's unstoppable money.

It's a payment tool, like visa, venmo, or paypal

## Bitcoin is the internet of money

Bitcoin is the native money of the internet, but it's much more than that, it's the internet of money

It's money for the internet, and the internet of money

Bitcoin is not just a money on the internet, it is the internet of money. The internet is programmable information. It is unrestricted, global, instantly transferable information. Bitcoin is programmable money, unrestricted, global, and instantly transferable money. The internet has allowed the coordination of humanity on a scale never before seen in human history, allowing for ideas and revolutions to spread like wildfire. Bitcoin allows for unrestricted financing, pairing global coordination with unrestricted payments and fundraising.

### Bitcoin is the foundation of a global monetary and financial system

it's a global monetary system and a global financial system

-   Eventually bitcoin will not only be the money of the world, but the digital financial infrastructure all other money is layered upon
    -   it's a whole new monetary and financial system that's based on the money being independent and uncontrollable

It's an internet protocol, and a technology stack

Bitcoin will not be the "money" used for every transaction but it will become the foundation that money is layered upon

From <[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN4klUUx8fM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN4klUUx8fM)\>

We're talking a new global financial and monetary system,

Based on rules, not rulers

# Other People's Bitcoin Definitions:

According to Google:

> Bitcoin is a protocol which implements a highly available, public, permanent, and decentralized ledger. In order to add to the ledger, a user must prove they control an entry in the ledger. The protocol specifies that the entry indicates an amount of a token, bitcoin with a minuscule b
> 
> Google

We've already established that a ledger is just a list of transactions, like a spreadsheet. And we've already discussed that decentralized just means it's hosted on tens of thousands of computers who all are in agreement with what's on the ledger. Google also mentions that the ledger is public hinting at bitcoin's transparency and permissionless availability.

What might still be confusing is the term protocol - an internet protocol is just a standardization of rules that allow computers to communicate with each other. Think of it like a language, a standard way of communicating. In Bitcoin terms the protocol keeps track of the ledger, governs how that ledger is updated and the limit of 21 million coins.

Adding to the ledger just means creating another transaction that will be recorded on the blockchain. The 'proof' that a user controls an entry in the ledger, just means that you are in control of the keys to unlock the bitcoin vault and move the money. Said another way, when you send a bitcoin to someone, what you're actually doing is updating the bitcoin spreadsheet, telling all the nodes that the money is moved from Alice to Bob.

According to the subreddit r/bitcoin:

> Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.
> 
> r/bitcoin

This definition leans a bit more into the token side of bitcoin. The difference between distributed and decentralized is just that distributed only means hosted on thousands of computers, whereas decentralized means no one is in charge. A distributed computer network can still be technically centralized if there are hierarchies.

The fact that bitcoins are issued and managed via computer software vs a central authority makes bitcoin apolitical and neutral. Similar to if we all transacted in gold coins that didn't have a face of a king on them. The advantage of non state money is of course the absence of inflation and fractional reserve bank runs, but there is also a layer of privacy and freedom from censorship that is afforded.

Being your own bank with bitcoin just means running your own software to verify for yourself that the money is yours, and having full autonomy over your money without counterparty risks.

While a bit complicated, in their Bitcoin 101 paper, NYDIG describes many bitcoin elements extremely succinctly:

> Bitcoin is an open source monetary system - that is, a system for storing and transmitting an asset of value whose underlying code is fully open to the public. This system allows bitcoin (lowercase “b”), the native digital asset of the Bitcoin network, to be sent securely between users over the internet without the need of an intermediary. Transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain through a process called mining.
> 
> NYDIG

*Bitcoin is an open source system*

All of bitcoin's code is available to inspect and it's in the public domain meaning you can freely copy and modify it. There's no copyright protections, and you can use the code for commercial purposes. The code that bitcoin runs is visible to everyone, and so are the updates. And it's voluntary meaning you don't even have to accept any changes or updates if you don't want to. Bitcoin is fully transparent for ethical reasons, but also so that it can replicate itself like a virus.

*Bitcoin is a monetary system*

You can send, hold, and receive bitcoin within the software stack. Just like PayPal or Venmo, or a bank account. In the same way that we have a global fiat monetary system, where money can be transferred around via payment processers and banks, bitcoin the currency can be transfered around via the bitcoin network

*bitcoin lowercase b is a native digital asset*

It's a token. Bitcoin spelled with a lower case b is usually referring to the money itself, like the dollar, and bitcoin with an uppercase B is referring to the network, like Paypal. It would be fucking weird if your credit card, banking system and cash were were all just called the Dollar. But in bitcoin the network and token have the same name which can be confusing.

*bitcoin is sent between people over the internet without an intermediary*

Think of bitcoin on the Bitcoin network like handing someone a physical gold coin or a dollar bill. When you pay in person for something there's no one in the middle of that transaction. All digital money before bitcoin had to go through some company or bank or government, someone you had to trust to pay you back. Someone who took fees, or took 7-10 business days, or who declined your transaction or froze your withdrawal. Someone who needs to get the money from someone else first, in a never ending chain of IOUs.

Bitcoin removes all of that garbage from banking. There's no one in between you and the person you're paying. The transmission is instead handled by autonomous computer code and a global competition.

*Transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain through a process called mining*.

So mining bitcoin is a bit complicated and not something I'll cover here. But the funny way to think about mining is that it's like running your PlayStation 24 hours a day resulted in solved sudokus you could trade for heroine. But basically what you have to know is that it is the process that settles bitcoin transactions and keeps them record forever.

> The bitcoin network is a global decentralized consensus network which operates on a cryptographic p2p protocol - on top of the Internet - established by individuals \[computers / nodes\] all around the world who run the [**Bitcoin Core Software**](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) \[free open-source software\] program which enforce Consensus Rules through an process called **Bitcoin Mining** which relay and validate UTXO transactions and record state to an immutable append-only Distributed Ledger; Bitcoin Blockchain.

Ok this is another loaded one, but by far the most accurate and comprehensive bitcoin explanation I've ever found.

Decentralized Consensus Network

Cryptographic

P2P Protocol

Bitcoin Core Software \[free open-source\]

Consensus rules

UTXO transactions

Immutable append only distributed ledger

And last but certainly not least:

> Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.

WOW *a collection of concepts and technologies* how can you get any more confusing than that!

How do you describe something which is really a collection of many things? And not just a collection of many things...

...bitcoin is *a collection of many ideas*.

Neutrality, Transparency, Privacy, Security, Equality, Freedom, Autonomy, Trust, Cosmopolitanism, Justice, Peace, Human rights, etc.

Bitcoin is more than just a money, it's a cryptographic digital money ecosystem *and a belief system*.

# Bitcoin is like nothing you've ever encountered

## Bitcoin is a Rube Goldberg Machine

So many moving parts!!

## Bitcoin is a Justice System

> I had never believed in God, but in 2013, I discovered Bitcoin...the more I studied it, the more I realized that this is an incorruptible system...that this is a system that has justice built into it through math and truth.”
> 
> Tomer Strolight

-   Bitcoin is a justice arbitrator, like an automated court of law and executive system combined, it solves disputes in a peaceful nonviolent way, deciding what transactions came first, and what transactions are valid, through a process called Nakamoto consensus
    -   This is a system that has justice built into it through math and truth
-   Bitcoin is property rights codified. Rights that are written into code, code that can't be changed or erased. Property rights that are available for anyone in the world, even those without first world legal systems

## Bitcoin is alchemy

Bitcoin is alchemy, people turn electricity into gold

## Bitcoin is Energy

## Bitcoin is Physics

## Bitcoin is Metaphysics

Bitcoin can also be compared to a form of digital metaphysics, where its blockchain records create a new form of digital ontology that questions the nature of reality and existence. In this analogy, Bitcoin's decentralized nature creates a new form of digital being that transcends traditional notions of space, time, and matter.

## Bitcoin is a Religion

-   Bitcoin is a religion,

## Bitcoin is an Organism

-   Bitcoin is an organism, some even would argue it's alive. It consumes, grows, reproduces, and lives autonomously.
-   it's self adjusting
-   like a virus or a bacteria. Bitcoin's survival and growth depend on its ability to adapt and evolve in response to external pressures, such as regulatory challenges or technological advancements.

## Bitcoin is a tank

## Bitcoin is a battery

-   Bitcoin is a battery, storing energy across time and teleporting it across space
    -   Money is a battery of labor energy, when you work 40 hours you're paid for your time, some people's time is worth more than others but still what you get in return for all of your hours working is a medium to store that energy for future productive use. You can spend all day fishing and get that exchanged for movie tickets. That's the power of money. Now imagine not only can you store your time and energy into a medium where it could be teleported all over the world without friction. The digital communities that can be built will not rely on physical location 

## Bitcoin is a Telephone

## Bitcoin is a Messaging App

## Bitcoin is a Login Tool

## Bitcoin is a form of Identification

Bitcoin is voting verification: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/documentary-bitcoin-guatemalas-presidential-elections

## Bitcoin is Insurance

Bitcoin is a credit default swap, a way to insure yourself against the failures of other currencies

## Bitcoin is the AI of money

In the same way that artificial intelligence will have profound societal consequences in ways we can't predict, a self-sustaining monetary system has been dropped like a nuke into our digital economy,

There's just so much that it is going to cause and reorganize in this world its truly insane

## Bitcoin is a black hole

Bitcoin is game theory designed to hijack human greed to keep itself alive and uncorrupted. It’s a series of game theoretic feedback loops that imbed it further and further into society. It was designed with human nature in mind, to hijack our greed and increase its price forever. Increases in price secure the network even more. It will slowly absorb all of the wealth in the world.

## Bitcoin is a Game

Bitcoin is a game, it's a lottery designed to financially incentivize humans to distribute its code and to protect its network.

When people mine bitcoin they solve difficult mathematical puzzles in order to win the bitcoin lottery

However, these mathematical puzzles are actually designed to be like an annoying captcha and prevent scammers and bots from winning too much money. They keep the system honest and safe from bad actors

## Bitcoin is a vault in cyberspace

Bitcoin has a completely over-the-top security structure in order to keep itself alive and keep the ledger from being corrupted.

> Bitcoin is like the entire United States military being used to fortify one small playground, somewhere deep in the rocky mountains.

Bitcoin is the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth. In fact, if every other supercomputer combined their computing power, they still wouldn’t be able to double spend or halt transactions. Bitcoin can't ever be shut down, it updates it's puny 4mb ledger about every 10 minutes, and is designed to do this forever.

But the real security comes from bitcoin's cryptography. A bitcoin address, more easily understood as a vault, is the most secure holding place for money in human history.

These vaults are in cyberspace, and they are impossible to crack open. It's complicated to know why they are impossible to break into, but it is truly fascinating.

The number of addresses or aka vaults in cyberspace, is unfathomably large. Every human that has ever lived, and will ever live, will each have trillions of different addresses that they can use, or vaults they can create, because well, it's the internet, and programming impossibly huge numbers is cool.

In fact, a fraudster guessing the key code to your Bitcoin wallet has roughly the same odds as someone winning a Powerball lottery (a 1 in 300,000,000 chance) nine times in a row. Guessing and checking numbers until the head death of the universe.

In order to move your bitcoin out of your vault, you need to use your keys. As long as you don't tell anyone aka, give them your keys, it's impossible for someone to move them from your vault.

In fact, millions of bitcoin have already been accidentally locked away forever, aka people lost their keys, and there's no way of getting them out of their vaults. No government, bank, corporation, secret society, international financial institution, oligarch, pope, dictator, or king can ever retrieve them. There is no group that controls bitcoin that could hard fork the code and give you your money back. These vaults are the most secure place to store value ever in the history of humanity.

Maybe compare it to gringots, but in cyberspace

# Bitcoin is a revolution

-   Really though, the best way I can describe Bitcoin is that it's a global project to create an independent money and monetary system

-   Bitcoin is not the US dollar, Its not the pound, or Yen, it's an electronic money system designed outside of the existing financial system, and it runs on the internet. It's totally neutral.
-   That may seem simple at first, but I can assure you this is extremely profound and revolutionary,

Imagine creating an unstoppable technology that uses game theory to hijack human greed to spread itself around the world with the ultimate goal of undermining the most powerful monopoly in human history.

It's a globally coordinated project to build an escape catch from government fiat currencies.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money. And the corruption that comes with it.

Bitcoin is the separation of money and state.

Imagine the most powerful tool of civilization, pried from the clutches of the elite.

Bitcoin frees humanity from the state monopoly on money and will usher an era of prosperity and freedom.

Bitcoin is the manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age

-   Like the manhattan project, bitcoin is an enormous globally coordinated research and development initiative, a race to develop an ultimate technology, a technology to establish permanent human freedom, and individual sovereignty on earth.

Bitcoin is the real occupy wall street

Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science, and is the first accounting innovation in 700 years. It solved a decades old computer science problem enabling absolute, immutable scarcity. It's a highly-complex technological achievement and advancement for society.

[https://steemit.com/ripple/@mooncryption/the-truth-behind-ripple-and-why-i-sold-it-all](https://steemit.com/ripple/@mooncryption/the-truth-behind-ripple-and-why-i-sold-it-all)

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto invented the world's first cryptocurrency— Bitcoin, on the principle that we can free ourselves from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and move money in a much more decentralized fashion

…

The real power of bitcoin is this idea that a corporation or an individual can take self custody of their own property. And self custody is imperative for sovereignty and freedom and liberty

Bitcoin is disruptive, and that is precisely why it is so difficult to swallow, to swaddle into traditional investment terms.

Bitcoin is the first completely decentralized transnational platform for exchanging value, it has no borders, and doesn't care whether you like a transaction or not, it is entirely based on mathematical verifiability. It is the internet, unleashed, unvarnished, unpolished, and uncensorable. And if you can't swallow that pill, there's a startup out there that will embrace that innovation and disrupt your industry. - Andreas

Bitcoin can be compared to so many things, but if you really dig into the third and fourth order effects, of this thing when it gets just a little bit bigger, it becomes obvious that bitcoin is equivalent to digital a monetary nuclear weapons, it's hardness as a monetary good, and it's absolute scarcity is the ultimate store of value tool, it obsoletes existing monies and monetary systems in a truly worrying way, this is an economic experiment that no one is really sure exactly how it's all going to turn out

 From *The Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence*. The declaration includes a message of crypto-anarchism with the words: "Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian."

From <[https://dergigi.com/2022/04/03/inalienable-property-rights/](https://dergigi.com/2022/04/03/inalienable-property-rights/)\>

*The whole point of Bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money. As Szabo put it: "\[Bitcoin\] implements data integrity via computer science rather than via 'call the cops'". Nobody can help you if you* *lose* *forget your private key. Nobody can reverse a transaction once it is confirmed and buried beneath a couple of blocks. It doesn't matter who you call.*

From <[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)\>

 [*The Economist*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist) describes bitcoin as "a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks".[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#cite_note-30082018Economist-207)

From <[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vno0eg/describe\_bitcoin\_in\_12\_sentences\_in\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vno0eg/describe_bitcoin_in_12_sentences_in_the_most/)\>

Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science cryptography, enabling absolute, immutable scarcity, the result of which, enables the freedom of humanity from the oppressive monetary exploitation of the state.

From <[https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b](https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b)\>

More than just a new monetary technology, Bitcoin is an entirely new economic paradigm: an uncompromisable base money protocol for a global, digital, non-state economy.

Bitcoin is the manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age

Its a huge, research and development project to build a new global financial system,

To build human rights protection software stack, not just an invincible money

To fight back against the encroachment of social engineering, financial repression, digital surveillance state

 free from the manipulation of elites, corporations and authoritarian governments

To give property rights, fair and neutral money, to 8 billion people

It's our only hope in freeing humanity from the digital prison of central bank digital currencies, savings debasement and debt slavery

What most people don't understand is that bitcoin is an ecosystem of projects, some of the smartest people I've ever heard of in my life, all working together, from everywhere on earth, to build truly unstoppable freedom technology without the permission of their governments

It's not about getting rich, it's about being free

You might not care about bitcoin and you might not need it yet

But there are billions of humans on this planet who stand to benefit from bitcoin

So we'll continue to build, even if you don't like what we're doing.

Because bitcoin is truly unstoppable,

So even if you don't believe us, even if you don't get it. It truly doesn't matter

bitcoin doesn't need you, but it'll be there be there when you need bitcoin

The revolutionary movement that Satoshi started isn't limited to just bitcoin. Using cryptography to create freedom technology was once a niche corner of humanity. Now people from all around the world are dedicating their lives to create decentralized, unstoppable, and leaderless systems. Privacy tools for preserving liberty in the great digital transformation.
