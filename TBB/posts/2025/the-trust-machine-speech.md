Ok to kick off this talk, I'm going to need everyone to take out some cash, a $1 bill, $20 and if you don’t haven’t any please just share with your neighbor

(Wait a few seconds)

Ok if someone would be so kind to let me borrow a bill just a few seconds for this demonstration

(Wait a few seconds) (put it in pocket)

Ok all kidding aside, please flip it over and take a look at the back

(I take out a bill and hold it up) 

Printed on every dollar bill is the phrase "In god we trust", and yet, we don't trust god with our money, we put trust in humans, who have corrupted our monetary systems time and time again.

You see, when it comes to money, humans are incentivized to cheat

Go figure,

We trust humans to safeguard money, to mint coins, and to run our economy, but that system is ripe for corruption.

And what sucks is we HAVE to trust in humans. We can’t give the job to donkeys.

If we don’t have people to safeguard our money than other humans will just steal it. It’s a dilemma as old as time.

A dilemma Ive so aptly named "The trusting humans with money problem"

Not because humans are naturally bad or evil —  It’s incentives and game theory

History has shown that if the money is centralized into the hands of humans, it can and will be corrupted, no matter how many checks and balances, and layers of democracy you put over it

As the saying goes, Power corrupts and absolute power prints money

Why is this a problem?

Money is the bedrock of civilization, just like language, 

Which is a big problem if humans are incentivized to corrupt it

Imagine if the english language could be used to steal from you, control you, or enslave you.  

Well money is, all the time.

Money is used by authoritarian regimes as a tool of control, oppressing billions of the poorest people on earth. 

Wealth is extracted from society and concentrated in the hands of the well-connected elites.

And debt slavery is systemically leveraged to socially engineer a permanent working class.

And most sinister of all,

Rich countries exploit the global south through structural adjustment loans, also known as debt colonialism, 

Impoverishing, endangering and killing millions of people; 

enriching dictators and kleptocrats 

and causing trillions of dollars of food, natural resources and cheap labor to flow from poor to rich nations annually, benefiting former colonial powers and multinational corporations.

Unfortunately none of this is new. Throughout history, trust in money has been abused and manipulated, leading to breakdowns and inefficiencies in society.

But what if I told you there was a way to Trust god with our money? 

Or a god-like computer algorithm

A trust…machine?

That's where bitcoin comes in. 

Bitcoin is revolutionary because it is a trust machine. Bitcoin manufactures trust because it auto-magically runs itself.

Instead of humans you are trusting in math, physics, code, and probabilities.

Instead of debt slavery, bank bailouts, or inflation, you're trusting software with an ethical monetary policy. 

I’m gonna do my best to break down the complexity of the trust machine so you can see why it's so revolutionary.

Because if we can't trust god with money, a trust machine is our only hope.

Ok quick recap, It’s simple, humans can't be trusted to maintain a currency so we turned towards computers and technology.

You see, by separating money from human decision making, you've effectively solved a problem as old as civilization itself   
  
Unlike today’s currency which is maintained by banks, corporations, and governments, bitcoin is open source software, a monetary system that is instead run on top of the internet.  
 

This is so much more than a digital coin

This is an automated justice system programmed into software, software that’s incorruptible, secure, and eternal. Software that no human can change.

No dictator, no king, no president, no CEO, no billionaire, no illuminati,

This is the trust machine.

For the first time in history we have a money that can’t be used to steal from us, a money that can’t be used to control us, A fair, ethical and trustworthy way to organize society.

Bitcoin is revolutionary because this had never been done before, and has yet to be replicated since. Every other money, blockchain, or crypto can be changed by some powerful special interests, and therefore isn't a trust machine. 

 In conclusion, 

Money is used as an instrument of power to control all of us and to create wars and kill people

Bitcoin removes humans from the control over money, solving the "Trusting humans with money problem"

Replacing a system that is manipulated, debased and untrustworthy to one that you can trust. 

A system where the rules can’t be changed to benefit the rich and powerful. 

Our leaders proclaim "in god we trust!"

Our rulers proclaim, "you can trust in us"

Bitcoin doesn't proclaim, 

it executes

No Leaders. 

No Rulers. 

In Code We Trust.
