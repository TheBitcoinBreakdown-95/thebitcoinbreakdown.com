1. Portability
    1. Salability over space/time/scales
    2. Bitcoin is the separation of property and earth
        1. This is good for mobility reasons but also for digitizing wealth putting it beyond the reach of humans

The only thing you need to open a "Bitcoin account" is mathematics, and the only thing you need to send or receive payments is a communications channel. -Gigi

One of the shortcomings with gold and why we had to use gold derivatives  
Bitcoin is a piece of supergold flying around the world at the speed of light  
It's the perfect money for a global internet economy

- Steganography,
- the blockstream satelite,
- mobile phone revolution in other countries,
- brain wallets,
- Refugees escaping other countries
- Remittances - Bitcoins are the most portable store of value ever used by man. Private keys representing hundreds of millions of dollars can be stored on a tiny USB drive and easily carried anywhere. Furthermore, equally valuable sums can be transmitted between people on opposite ends of the earth near instantly. Fiat currencies, being fundamentally digital, are also highly portable. However, government regulations and capital controls mean that large transfers of value usually take days or may not be possible at all. Cash can be used to avoid capital controls, but then the risk of storage and cost of transportation become significant. Gold, being physical in form and incredibly dense, is by far the least portable. It is no wonder that the majority of bullion is never transported. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself. Transmitting physical gold across large distances is costly, risky and time-consuming.

         - The digital communities that can be built will not rely on physical location
    - I know we all hate talking about the metaverse but what about internet communities in general, literally everyone needs money for everything,
    - we've built this attention economy as a way to get rewarded for building on the internet, but what if we had a services economy, everyone will want to be paid in
      

If a teenager in Venezuela wants to get paid in a hard currency for a web development gig they did for someone in Paris, something prohibited by local currency controls, cryptocurrencies can make it possible. Bitcoin may not yet really be private money, but it is the first “free” money.
