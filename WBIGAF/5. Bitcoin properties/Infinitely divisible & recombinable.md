1. Infinitely divisible
    1. It doesn't have to be inflationary if it's a debit based system, by being infinitely divisible it can expand with the economy
    2. It can store all of the wealth in the solar system
    3. In a debit based system, you don't need inflation to expand the money supply as the economy grows, you need an infinitely divisible money to subdivide and absorb the growing economy
    4. Anyone on earth can afford a little piece of bitcoin
    5. You can do microtransactions
2. Recombinable
    1. Can put it back together into larger units
    2. Historically difficult to do, which made metals so good as money

But a bitcoin can be subdivided into fractional coins, so its usefulness to pay for things isn’t constrained by limited supply. The smallest unit of a bitcoin is called a Satoshi, after Satoshi Nakamoto, the supposed inventor of the currency (although nobody really knows for sure if this is a real person or the pseudonym used by a group of people responsible for bitcoin’s creation). A Satoshi is one one-hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001), which at today’s prices is equivalent to about two one-hundredths of a cent. This implies that participants in the system can own less than a single coin and; in fact, far less than a single coin. This enables commerce and transfers based on smaller notional values.
   
7. **Divisible** ==- Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](== ==https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit)====), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin.== \> From \<[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11sswss/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11sswss/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read/)\>
