- [Client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server): architectures where smart clients contact the server for data then format and display it to the users. Input at the client is committed back to the server when it represents a permanent change.
- [Three-tier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_\(computing\)): architectures that move the client intelligence to a middle tier so that [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol) clients can be used. This simplifies application deployment. Most web applications are three-tier.
- _n_-tier: architectures that refer typically to web applications which further forward their requests to other enterprise services. This type of application is the one most responsible for the success of [application servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server).

- [Peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer): architectures where there are no special machines that provide a service or manage the network resources.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing#cite_note-Vigna20150127-37): 227  Instead all responsibilities are uniformly divided among all machines, known as peers. Peers can serve both as clients and as servers.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing#cite_note-38) Examples of this architecture include [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and the [bitcoin network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network).
    
"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own".[[4]](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#cite_note-4)
   

It can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)

Distributed programming typically falls into one of several basic architectures: [client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server), [three-tier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_\(computing\)), _n_-tier, or [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer); or categories: [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling), or [tight coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster).[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing#cite_note-36)
