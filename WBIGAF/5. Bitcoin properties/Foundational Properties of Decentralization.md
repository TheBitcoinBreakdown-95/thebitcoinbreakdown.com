    1. Hash rate is the value prop
    2. Node distribution
    3. Nakamoto consensus
        1. Truth through physics, not humans
    4. This is the biggest differentiator between bitcoin and everything else that has ever existed
    5. Satoshi left the project December 21st 2010 and has never been heard from again
    6. The whole point of bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money
    7. It's its own, independent monetary system. The separation of money and state

3. Bitcoin is extremely decentralized, far more than any other cryptocurrency, establishing it as the first (and only) immutable ledger in history…Imagine, a way to create a record that can never be destroyed or altered, it's like a fucking golden tablet on cyberspace mountain, which can never be reached, but it can be read by all.

“Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.” — Nassim Nicolas Taleb

6. The hash rate is bitcoins value proposition
    - It’s decentralized nature, and that it can’t ever be changed
7. Bitcoin makes decentralization possible, which is to say its center of gravity is the empowerment of the individual. Its very nature takes control away from the few and gives it back to the many.

Rather than store transactions on any single server or set of servers, Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power.

One thing bitcoin always does is that it refuses to die, it is a relentless anomaly, the reason it refuse to die is because there is no center, there is nothing to co-opt, nothing to stamp down, there's nothing to shut down, filter or control because it is completely decentralized. And it takes a while to understand that. Don't make the mistake of ignoring the disruptive potential of Bitcoin, so you can get some watered down, smooth jass, soft version of it, that feels comfortable at the executive boardroom.
   

when it comes to money, the state has all the motivation in the world to shut down a competing system. This - and only this - is why Bitcoin’s design is so intricate and complicated. Its incentive-driven architecture favors one thing above all else: survival. Because you would have to destroy all parts of it simultaneously, a radically decentralized system is extremely resilient to any kind of disruption

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto invented the world's first cryptocurrency— Bitcoin, on the principle that we can free ourselves from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and move money in a much more decentralized fashion  
Hold up— what does decentralized even mean? It's the opposite of the word "centralized", but what does that mean in the first place?  
Using regular money via the normal banking system requires going through different layers of regulation, from the bank itself, to perhaps a clearing house, maybe other middlemen, and even after passing through those layers your money may get frozen in place by the central government.  
This is a "centralized" system. One, or a few entities have overwhelming control of the entire system, and you do not have control over your money.  
Decentralized is just the opposite. Rather than a few entities having control over the system, many users help support the weight of the network. No single user can make a change without approval of other users, and the entire system works coherently and harmoniously.  
With Bitcoin (a decentralized system) and many other cryptocurrencies, you do have control over your money. Do you have to get approval from a bank to send Bitcoin? Can the government freeze your money? No.
