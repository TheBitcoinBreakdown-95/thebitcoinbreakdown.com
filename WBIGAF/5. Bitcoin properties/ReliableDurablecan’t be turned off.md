“Bitcoin reclaiming its all-time high yet again shows it is never going away,” said Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital. “In its 15 years of existence, bitcoin has seen four 75% [plus] drawdowns, and each time it has come roaring back.”

The resilience of Bitcoin in the event of an Internet outage is considerable due to its decentralized nature, redundant data storage, and ability to use alternative communication methods. While the complete and permanent shutdown of the Internet is highly improbable, Bitcoin's design ensures that it could potentially survive and recover from extreme disruptions. This resilience may be a factor for individuals considering Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy, particularly in comparison to traditional currencies and assets.
   

Bitcoin literally only has one job. Survival. One of the main breakthroughs of bitcoin was to be more durable than any digital currency that came before it.  
Since the durability of bitcoin is an extension of the durability of the internet itself, bitcoin is protected by the larger digital economy. It's software is easily replicated, decentralized and impossible to stamp out. And it's tens of thousands of nodes are globally distributed and backed up with hundreds of billions of dollars in economic incentives keeping the system alive.
   

Trying to stop superior technology never works. Especially a bottom up merit based market chosen money. I wish them luck in trying to stop digital gold. -GC
   
- "Running non-stop for nine years, with almost zero financial loss on the chain itself, Bitcoin has become the most reliable and secure financial network in the world. When you send a valid Bitcoin transaction, you can bet the farm on it that it will be sent and that it will be received by your intended recipient. It’s right up there with death and taxes."
- It's pretty much guaranteed at this point, bitcoin's whole purpose is that it can't be shut down.

I've tried so hard to find a weakness, but its security is _very literally unparalleled_  
You can create whatever forks you want, bitcoin will always exist. And there will never be more than 21 million. That kind of security guarantee is unique to both blockchains and the entire digital realm. You can use that bedrock foundation for so many things, all programmable on top of bitcoin. It's more than a coin, it's a financial system.
 - Zoltan says that if bitcoin survives it will be 6 fugues
    
    - Guy swann says this whole thing is a game of survival, can we keep a decentralized apolitical global neutral currency sustained, can wrk keep it safe, can we protect it, can we keep it alive, because if it stays alive it’s going to be utterly massive. That’s all it needs to do
    
    - On this fateful night in 2008, Satoshi let the genie out of the bottle. We went from a world where digital cash was just an idea to a world where Bitcoin exists. Not only is the idea here to stay, but with every passing block, Bitcoin reminds us that this idea is now a reality. As we shall see, this new reality is more powerful than one might think at first. It is powerful because it will usher in a new economic paradigm. It is powerful because the time is ripe for it. It is powerful because it can’t be stopped. As Victor Hugo reminds us: nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. Bitcoin is here to stay; and Bitcoin’s time is now.
- Bitcoin can't be banned, it can only be delayed
- Each bitcoin transaction is validated and confirmed by the entire bitcoin network, there's no single point of failure, so the system is virtually impossible to shut down, manipulate, or control

when it comes to money, the state has all the motivation in the world to shut down a competing system. This - and only this - is why Bitcoin’s design is so intricate and complicated. Its incentive-driven architecture favors one thing above all else: survival. Because you would have to destroy all parts of it simultaneously, a radically decentralized system is extremely resilient to any kind of disruption

Releasing his software into the wild set in motion a multi-decade process that is driven by an extremely powerful incentive structure. An unstoppable idea, embodied in code. It is this incentive structure that drives Bitcoin’s survival. And with every passing day that Bitcoin refuses to die, humanity is one step closer to freeing money from the capture of the state. It will take some time for the world to come to grips with this most powerful idea.

Former head of Meta’s cryptocurrency and fintech unit and co-founder of Diem, David Marcus, took to Twitter on Tuesday to vocalize his support for Bitcoin, predicting that it will be the “one asset and L1 still around in 20+ years.” Marcus spent years working on Meta’s Diem, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, before stepping down from his position late last year. 
   

you know the Bitcoin Community always optimize for security  
other platforms make trade-offs right so yes there are others that are faster they do more they're cheaper but they trade off security and decentralization in order to get that and  
Bitcoins persistently you know optimizing for security uh sets it up well as as these things you know will get attacked more and more over time uh but also means that it has that staying power and Longevity

Bitcoin is going to go up in price. Yes that's true but it's a byproduct for what is really going on. That's what people really need to understand, it's a money that's out of control.

==Durability:==  
==Gold is the undisputed King of durability. The vast majority of gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, remains extant today and will likely be available a thousand years hence. Gold coins that were used as money in antiquity still maintain significant value today. Fiat currency and bitcoins are fundamentally digital records that may take physical form (such as paper bills). Thus it is not their physical manifestation whose durability should be considered (since a tattered dollar bill may be exchanged for a new one), but the durability of the institution that issues them. In the case of fiat currencies, many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them. The Papiermark, Rentenmark and Reichsmark of the Weimar Republic no longer have value because the institution that issued them no longer exists. If history is a guide, it would be folly to consider fiat currencies durable in the long term — the US dollar and British Pound are relative anomalies in this regard. Bitcoins, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures them remains in place. Given that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, it is too early to draw strong conclusions about its durability. However, there are encouraging signs that, despite prominent instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks by hackers, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of “====anti-fragility====”.==

**Forward Compatibility**  
Bitcoin supports signing transactions without broadcasting them; there is a principle that any currently possible signed but not broadcast transactions should remain valid and broadcastable. A good example of this are transactions with nLocktime that are not valid for confirmation until after the time specified by the transaction; this could be used for inheritance or other time delayed purposes. There could be dangerous repercussions to changing this rule - an unknowable number of unbroadcast transactions could become invalid. No one wants to be responsible for destroying someone’s wealth because a rule upon which a user was relying was pulled out from underneath them.  
The fact that Bitcoin has stuck to this principle gives everyone confidence in the protocol. Anyone can secure their funds by whatever scheme they dream up and deploy it without needing permission. So long as they are following the rules of the protocol, the worst that might happen is for nodes to stop relaying certain transactions by default.

the utility of a monetary system is an inverse function of the uncertainty experienced by its users. **Bitcoin is the least uncertain monetary system in human history** as a result of its radical decentralization. By interacting with your own node and holding your own keys, as a user of the bitcoin system you can reduce your experienced uncertainty to the absolute minimum possible, within the limits of our current understanding of the laws of nature.  
…  
People hold money to hedge against future uncertainty. This is why it is so crucial for a monetary system to optimize for minimizing its own uncertainty.

Bitcoin’s architecture is ruthlessly optimized for _reliability under adversarial conditions_:

- It assumes _no trust_.
- It uses _physical energy_ as a Sybil-resistant signal.
- It requires _no leader, no synchronized clocks, and no identity system_.
- It converges on consensus through probabilistic finality rooted in objective cost.
