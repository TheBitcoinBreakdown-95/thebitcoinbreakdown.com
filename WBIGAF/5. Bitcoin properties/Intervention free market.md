1. Intervention free market
    1. At first this seems ironic to say, isn’t crypto the wild west of finance, ripe with wash trading, price manipulation, exit liquidity scams and rug pulls?
    2. When it comes to bitcoin, Whales can sell/buy bitcoin to move the price up and down, but that's basically all they can do
    3. Since bitcoin is a debit based system, all credit comes from additional layers and won't fundamentally affect the main asset
    4. The supply is perfectly inelastic which means no one can make more of it, even when the price goes up
    5. No one can acquire bitcoin unless they do the work mining it, or they earn it from someone else. Bitcoin is the hardest asset to confiscate so the only real way to acquire it is by providing a service.
    6. There's no banks to bail out, no lender of last resort, and no moral hazard
    7. The price crashes right away, and has gotten less and less volatile over time as weak hands sell to strong hands.
        1. Because the price crashes right away, there's no way for excess leverage to build up in the system, it gets flushed out pretty regularly, and therefore avoids systematic risks.
    8. It’s extremely hard to suppress the price like they’ve been suppressing gold, specially because of its digital nature and transparent monetary policy. The supply of gold is unknown and it’s difficult to verify or take custody of
    9. Price volatility builds character
        1. frequent clearing of leverage keeps the system from exploding but also it builds Market chads Who can withstand volatility   
4. Bitcoin's case for why it's a [10x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN2X4bUzgEg) value to society is it's putting a peg to a global economy that has no peg anywhere in sight for any country
    - It’s an incorruptible technology that can be used as a measuring stick, a global money completely neutral and hard capped, and transparent
      

Yes, billionaires and dictators can buy a lot of bitcoin, but they cannot control the system as they can with fiat money. Unlike with the dollar, euro or yuan model, they cannot tweak issuance, censor transactions, make special rules or bailouts for the aristocracy, or perform mass remote confiscation or debasement.

But being a young currency and technology means that its value fluctuates as it continues to find market-fit. The price volatility of bitcoin scares some people. That’s understandable. However, consider that many people see this volatility as the growing pains of a new (and better) financial system being put in place. Eventually, when the dust settles, people believe the value will stabilize.
