Bitcoin is the only totally neutral global digital money  
It’s value add is its neutrality  
It’s decentralized nature makes it completely unique, and it’s extremely secure  
It’s an independent third party, that has no allegiance
   

Think about it from a global banking cartel point of view  
Getting all central banks to join a single system is really difficult  
Who will manage the platform and who will everyone have to trust?  
With the recent weaponization of Forex reservs the BRICS nations will probably avoid deep ties to western payments infrastructure  
The bitcoin ledger, being trustless and ownerless, would be a much better solution in the geopolitical game theory  
Bitcoin is money for enemies  
Trust the open source algorithm vs nation states
 - No matter your political persuasion, you can look at bitcoin and find something you agree with.

It’s very rare that you find a technology that’s the solution to every rich person’s problem and every poor person’s problem simultaneously

- Bitcoin democratizes money in the same way that the internet democratizes information,

It flattens power structures and lifts all boats. Bitcoin doesn't care about your economic status, religion, gender, ethnicity, political views  
…bitcoin doesn't even care if you're a human…or a car, or a refrigerator, or a drone. Bitcoin enables automated, (and instant) value transfer, in a way that wasn't previously possible.

- Bitcoin is the only totally neutral global digital money.

It’s value add is its neutrality.  
It’s decentralized nature makes it completely unique, and it’s extremely secure  
It’s an independent third party, that has no allegiance

- With no political, national, or institutional origin, **Bitcoin is the most** **neutral** **money that humanity has ever created** — a truly universal, off-grid, incorruptible digital currency based on a decentralized blockchain network that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world because it is controlled by no one.

 9. ==Another analogy is to think of Bitcoin as a digital passport, where users can use their Bitcoin to access and participate in the global economy without being tied to a specific country or government. In this analogy, Bitcoin's decentralized nature creates a borderless financial system that anyone can participate in.==
