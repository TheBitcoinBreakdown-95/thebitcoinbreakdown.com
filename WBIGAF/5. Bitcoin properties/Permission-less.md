1. Permissionless
    1. Because bitcoin is pure information, because the network is open and neutral, and because there is no reliance on third parties, bitcoin can be sent without permission
    2. It's all about inclusion, with bitcoin you don't need to ask for permission to hold or send, it turns banking and property rights not into a privilege but a right
    3. It's all just math, anyone on earth can generate a private key because it's just a number
    4. Anyone on earth can send a bitcoin transaction without it being intercepted, censored, or stopped
    5. It's a public good, a public utility like the internet
        1. Digital public infrastrucutre maintained and operated by a distributed network
    6. It's accessible to everyone no exceptions
    7. There are many private ways to send a bitcoin transaction too, since it's all just information, you can send the transaction within an image, or a song, you can broadcast it via radio, call a phone service to decrypt, send it over satellite, or the easiest way via an app on your phone.

5. Bitcoin makes it possible to secure and transport your wealth without anyone's permission
6. The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for illicit activities is that it is “permissionless” at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant.
7. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, it is usable by anyone/anywhere/anytime. Developers can freely program applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol without having to ask anyone for permission.
8. I realized I like bitcoin and crypto in general because it’s all about taking freedom for ourselves, not waiting for permission or playing politics and playing fairly which is really just getting screwed over by those in power. It’s using technology to outsmart those in power, where a small number of individuals can overthrow the world order.

It may seem like libertarianism is losing in the world, authoritarianism/populism rising, but with the potential of a decentralized future, we'll just invent our way out of the legacy system and create a new one with freedom as the base layer. Imagine, decentralized statehood  
We are on the verge of a new transformation of money, of creating the first completely global, completely borderless, completely decentralized, completely open, form of money  
One where you can build applications because it is programmable  
One where you don't need permission to launch an application
