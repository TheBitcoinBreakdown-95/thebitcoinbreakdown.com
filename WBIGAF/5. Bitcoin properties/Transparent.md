7. Absolutely nothing about Bitcoin is a secret. It’s open source, anyone can review the code, anyone can contribute to the code, anyone can run the software voluntarily and participate in the network, and anyone can use the network without permission. The entire history of all Bitcoin transactions is visible to anyone in the world too. It’s the total opposite of a fraudulent investing scam, which is shrouded in vague promises of high returns with capital inflows and outflows that are kept in a secret ledger.

Open source:  
Open source software empowers individuals around the world while remaining independent of governments and large corporations who continuously attempt to track, censor, and control us. Many of these projects are not run for profit and do not have large budgets supporting them. Instead, they rely on an ever increasing network of individuals worldwide who contribute time and energy to build them out, often without compensation.

**Open Collaboration**  
While anyone is welcome to conduct research and development privately, any attempts to make protocol changes, especially non-backwards compatible changes, should occur in the open rather than behind closed doors. Bitcoin belongs to humanity, thus it is important that proposed changes be open to public comment. The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process is the recommended way to go about suggesting changes, though because no authority can enforce that the process be followed, it’s not a requirement.  
The issue of voluntary organization and the power dynamics that result from it can result in the perception that specific people or groups are authorities, but this is [an illusion of power.](https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/?ref=nakamoto.com)
