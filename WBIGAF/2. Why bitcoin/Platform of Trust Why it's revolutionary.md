- I'm stealing this 'platform of trust' line from Andreas
- It’s a completely self running computer program,
    - It does not rely on any trusted third party
    - All of bitcoin's functions are facilitated via computer programming
    - All of bitcoin's security features are based in math and probabilities
    - Bitcoin was designed to be simple, have no loopholes, be incredibly secure, and do one job and do it better than anything else
        - It doesn't have any bells or whistles and it doesn't try to be anything that it's not
- Bitcoin's most important feature is that it is a platform of trust
    - What does that mean?
    - Bitcoin is a trust machine
    - By solving the bysintine generals problem, satoshi invented a way for people to coordinate without needing to trust each other
    - With bitcoin, you are trusting math, you are trusting code, instead of trusting humans
    - Unlike today's currency which is backed by the government, bitcoin is backed digitally, meaning we trust in code and math instead of people
    - The whole motto of bitcoin is don't trust. verify
    - When it comes to money, people are incentivized to cheat, to take the easiest path possible, so when designing a system of money, satoshi flipped the incentive structure on it's head, in order to ensure that not only will everyone follow the rules, but also that following the rules is what makes you the most money.
    - The whole point of bitcoin is remove the distribution, production, and control over money from humans. And the corruption that comes with it
- You can trust that bitcoin won't cheat you. It doesn't even know who you are. All it knows is it's code. It has simple rules. If you want to send a unit of bitcoin, you have to provide the keys. It's that simple.
- You may be wondering what makes this so special? We have tons of institutions, built and refined over hundreds of years.
    - In the wise words of satoshi,
        - On the P2P Foundation forum, he commented that “the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”
        - "Bitcoin is a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust" -Satoshi
        - That's it that's the revolution, it's a whole new monetary and financial system that's based on the money being uncontrollable. The keys to unlimited wealth have been taken away from human beings and because of that society will flourish
    - Bitcoin is verifiably scarce. It's code
      
    

How can I trust that when I send you a bitcoin, you won't cheat me and just spend it twice? How can I trust that you will follow the rules? How can we both agree on how much bitcoin each of us owns? Information can just be copied over and over on the internet, in fact that's the point.
 
***If we each have an apple and we trade, we still only have one apple, but if you and I have an idea and we trade we each have two ideas. ****
 
**In order to solve this problem, Satoshi had to invent digital scarcity, he had to put physics into the internet, he had to recreate the law of conservation of energy, within cyberspace.**
 
To accomplish this task, he created a decentralized ledger, the first accounting innovation in over 700 years. Decentralized ledger just means that everyone is checking every transaction at all times, and everyone has access to the entire history of the ledger, for a fully transparent and fully secure money system.
 
Bitcoin is special because this had never been done before, and has yet to be replicated since. Every other blockchain can be changed by some powerful special interests. Bitcoin is the only immutable unchanging immortal and invincible network in the world.
 
Therefore, bitcoin has value because you can guarantee transactions are legitimate. You can trust that the ledger isn't fraudulent. You can trust that the money is really yours. You can verify for yourself that you are in possession.
 - What is bitcoin? Another metaphor I like to us is "The great excel spreadsheet in the sky". Think of it like an ultimate google doc, a shared spreadsheet in the cloud which is just a list of transactions. That's literally all bitcoin is, it's just a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.
    - Ok that's all well and good, but this great excel spreadsheet in the sky, why is that revolutionary?
    - Ok well let's spice up the metaphor a bit, bitcoin is digital gold right? So think of it like the excel sheet in the sky is actually more like a golden tablet in the clouds, this is some Moses shit, written into the tablet is a list of all of the bitcoin in the world, who sent it to who, who owns it, and who doesn't.
    - Once you send some bitcoin to someone, a new line is magically carved into the tablet and it stays there forever. Anyone can see this golden tablet, it's open and transparent and visible to all, but no one can change it. No one can actually touch this tablet, no one can change the rules. It exists beyond the clutches of humanity.
    - Because this tablet is immortal, it can't be corrupted by humanity. You can trust what this tablet says because it's impossible to corrupt.
    - What is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a truth machine. You can trust bitcoin because it's secured by math and by code, it's not controlled by humans. This is justice programmed into software, software that can't be changed.
        - It is a system of money that is not controlled by any single entity, that is completely decentralized, meaning bitcoin exists everywhere, it's in the clouds, there's no center, no single computer that can be hacked. It's incorruptible, it's secure, and it's eternal.
        - And not only is it decentralized and incorruptible, but remember the golden tablet magically updates itself, it has no owner, no one in control. When you send bitcoin to someone, there's no stopping the tablet from etching that transaction into itself for eternity.
        - Bitcoin is a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust -Satoshi
    - Bitcoin is not a company, it's not a corporation, or an organization. In fact it's a dis-organization. A very powerful dis-organization. It removes the need for humans to control money, it obsoletes the entire existing global monetary framework, it replaces a system of money you can't trust, to one that you can. A system where the rules can't be changed to benefit the rich and powerful. A system where no matter how much bitcoin you have, you can't alter the tablet. THAT is monetary revolution.
    - "Bitcoin technology facilitates a trustless economic system where borderless financial transactions can be finalized without intermediaries. While traditional banking and payment systems heavily rely on trust, Bitcoin offers a way out of this system with no third party to resolve the double-spending problem and maintain properties like censorship resistance, immutability and decentralization. Such a framework allowed the creation and implementation of a system effectively disjoined from government control, delivering a revolutionary separation of money and state for the first time in history. Bitcoin breaks all models we’re used to, starting with reduced state power and control" [- Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin)
    - Hohoho well I'm getting ahead of myself a bit here haha - The network is as unchanging and as automatic as the laws of physics, like handing a piece of gold to someone. So bitcoin keeps track of the gold and the transfer. There is no third-party involved when you hand a rock to someone, Gold is an element from nature, and physics governs the rules to hand a rock to someone else. Bitcoin is the money and the network, it’s both matter and the laws of physics that governs it, except this is all existing in cyberspace.
    1. Usually there's no physics in cyberspace, you can copy a file as many times as you want, or to extend the metaphor, you could hand some gold to thousands of people at the same time.
    2. Bitcoin establishes a set of unchanging laws of physics in cyberspace, it's the law of the conservation of energy   
- What is bitcoin?
    - "Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough in Computer Science, a highly-complex technological achievement and advancement for society: Bitcoin is the world's largest super-computer and is growing at a rapid clip, reinventing money as we know it."
        - "Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in cryptography, enabling absolute, immutable scarcity, the result of which, enables the freedom of humanity from the oppressive monetary exploitation of the state."
- Bitcoin is a trust machine and is obsoleting trusted human institutions, fundamentally altering existing power structures, it's a revolutionary invention that has changed the course of human history. 
**WHY IS BITCOIN REVOLUTIONARY?**

==Bitcoin was developed in the backdrop of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, which was brought about by the irresponsible risk-taking and lending practices of banks around the world. Despite their reckless behavior, many banks received government bailouts, which led to widespread protests and overall lack of confidence in the global financial system.==  
==Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to the “inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.” It is no coincidence that Nakamoto inscribed the following message in Bitcoin’s Genesis Block:== _The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks_==. This message is widely regarded as not only a timestamp but a call to arms.==

Bitcoin is a trust machine. Our entire economy relies on trust to function, the less trust there is the higher the cost of business and the less efficient our whole system is. You can trust a bitcoin transaction to go through.
                         

The purpose of bitcoin is to bring full sovereignty to the individual, and to remove all dependencies on trusted third parties. No rulers, no master, no hosts,only peers -GiGi

1. Platform of trust
    1. Solved byzantine general's problem
    2. Trust machine, the rules are set in code, you don't have to trust anyone with your money
    3. No double spend, invention of digital scarcity
    4. Bitcoin isn't a company, it’s not an organization, it doesn’t have anyone in charge, it’s the ultimate neutral third party
    5. It’s best to think of bitcoin as a combination of digital gold and PayPal, where you can send gold at the speed of light,
        1. The network is as unchanging and as automatic as the laws of physics, like handing a piece of gold to someone. So bitcoin keeps track of the gold and the transfer. There is no third-party involved when you hand a rock to someone, Gold is an element from nature, and physics governs the rules to hand a rock to someone else.

    6. Bitcoin was the invention of digital property, and it’s the only crypto network that has its own laws of physics . Every other chain has a dev team or a ceo who can roll back and hardfork if they really need it. Bitcoin is the only project that works on its own, like if
    7. **Bitcoin solves the agency problem in base layer money and financial systems**
        1. **Because money is universally desirable, there's moral hazard and conflicts of interest within institutions that hold and manage it,**
        2. **buy separating money from human decision making, you've effectively solved a problem as old as civilization itself**   

To solve the Byzantine Generals Problem and issue digital money without a central coordinator, Nakamoto proposed to keep the economic ledger in the hands of thousands of individuals around the world. Each participant would hold an independent, historical, and continually-updating copy of all transactions that Nakamoto originally called a ==timechain==. If one participant tried to cheat and “double-spend,” everyone else would know and reject that transaction.

[Introduction to Bitcoin: what is bitcoin and why does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0)  
Forget everything you think you know about bitcoin  
Bitcoin has so many layers  
It isn't what it appears at first glance  
Blockchain isn't a system of currency  
It's a platform of trust  
Its not a company  
It's not a product  
It's not a service that you sign up for  
~~It's not just a currency, currency is just the first application~~
 
Bitcoin isn't an organization, it's a disorganization, a very powerful disorganization
 
It's not money for the internet, but the internet of money  
 
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-fidelity-got-wrong-in-bitcoin-first](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-fidelity-got-wrong-in-bitcoin-first)  
Bitcoin is a direct response to the financial crisis of 2008 and the inability of our centralized systems to take proper action. Bitcoin is an opt-out monetary good that allows the user to exit the nation-state system and take sovereignty of their own wealth. It is a voice against wrongful and misguided authority and the embodiment of protest.
   

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2022/03/31/why-bitcoin-uses-energy/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2022/03/31/why-bitcoin-uses-energy/)  
They also don't need to trust anyone to hold their Bitcoin (instead they can simply hold the private keys to their money anywhere they can safely store them).   
This contrasts with the U.S. dollar system, where users need to trust public reporting statistics from institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve to know basic facts like how many U.S. dollars are in circulation, and trust politicians to maintain these aspects of the economy in a way that promotes their personal or commercial welfare.  
Likewise, when new money is issued in the fiat ecosystem, it always occurs at the request of policymakers who work with financial institutions to lend out the new money, entering it into circulation. As on blockchains that do not use energy, new money is awarded based on existing capital and influence.  
During this process, any number of stakeholders can be advantaged over others.
    
Gigi -  
The problem is, and what computer scientists tried to solve for 50 years plus, is that in the informational realm you can copy information indefinitely, if you can read information you can also copy it, so you can't have a token in the digital realm that can't be copied, if you can read it you can write it down again and that's basically how computers work, they are basic copy machines, so digital scarcity is kind of an oxymoron and was never possible before bitcoin.
 
Historically we've found physical objects to represent this value, gold coins speak for themselves, anyone who is in possession is proving that they can redeem this object for value because that value isn't lost, or debased

==the subtlety of the Two Generals' Problem is in the impossibility of designing algorithms for the generals to use to safely agree to the above statement.==  
==Illustrating the problem====[====edit====]==
 
==The first general may start by sending a message "Attack at 0900 on August 4." However, once dispatched, the first general has no idea whether or not the messenger got through. This uncertainty may lead the first general to hesitate to attack due to the risk of being the sole attacker.==
 
==To be sure, the second general may send a confirmation back to the first: "I received your message and will attack at 0900 on August 4." However, the messenger carrying the confirmation could face capture and the second general may hesitate, knowing that the first might hold back without the confirmation.==
 
==Further confirmations may seem like a solution—let the first general send a second confirmation: "I received your confirmation of the planned attack at 0900 on August 4." However, this new messenger from the first general is liable to be captured, too. Thus it quickly becomes evident that no matter how many rounds of confirmation are made, there is no way to guarantee the second requirement that each general is sure the other has agreed to the attack plan. Both generals will always be left wondering whether their last messenger got through.==

==What Is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)?==  
The [Byzantine Generals’ Problem](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-generals-problem) is a famous abstraction that serves to demonstrate one of the key problems in computer science, especially in regard to distributed computer systems (of which [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/cryptocurrency) is an example).  
==Imagine several Byzantine generals camped around an enemy city who communicate with each other only via sending messengers. They have to make a collective decision on whether to attack the city or retreat. However, some of the generals are traitors and may actively work against reaching a consensus. Is it possible to create a system that will ensure that the loyal generals decide on a common plan of action regardless of available knowledge on which generals are the traitors?==  
==A thorough analysis of the problem shows that such an algorithm is possible, but only if more than two-thirds of generals are loyal.==  
[Decentralized](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) are in essence distributed computer systems: their networks are composed of individual [nodes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node) operated by independent people or organizations that compete to process [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transaction-tx) and add them to the end of the [blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain). With nodes separated geographically and independent of each other or any central authority, it is impossible to reliably know which nodes are supplying faulty information about transactions — either maliciously or by accident.  
_Byzantine Fault Tolerance_ refers to the property of a distributed computer system that allows it to overcome this problem and consistently form [consensus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/distributed-consensus) regardless of the fact that some nodes disagree with the rest, either accidentally or on purpose. This can be achieved via technical solutions, such as Bitcoin’s [proof-of-work](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/proof-of-work-pow) algorithm, but only if more than two-thirds of nodes remain loyal to the system.
