5. They invented a better money, who does that
    1. It's the first accounting innovation in 700 years, decentralized verification that is
    2. Bitcoin is the culmination of decades of research, and some genius/team who put it all together

        1. Monetary properties are superior to that of gold and fiat, was designed from the ground up to have the strongest monetary properties of any asset in history
        2. Put the fidelity picture here
    4. It's a piece of super gold, ~~flying~~ teleporting around the world at the speed of light through an unstoppable paypal, with no one in control 7. Ok to kick off the bitcoin is good as fuck series I wanted to start off dispelling a common bitcoin myth right off the bat
8. A lot of people are skeptical of bitcoin because they don't really understand what it brings to the table
9. Let me tell you straight up bitcoin is the wine and the pastafazool
10. Bitcoin is the first accounting innovation in over 700 years
11. The last time there was any big revelation in bookkeeping was double booking accounting, popularized by the Medici and Florentine banking families, setting off an explosion of wealth and the renaissance
12. Bitcoin is the invention of the decentralized ledger, of full accounting transparency, and of digital scarcity, which in our internet age will also result in a similar explosion of prosperity   
15. Make a mention of John Nash's ideal money, to be expanded on in energy money section 17. Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible. …PG 1. Mastering bitcoin.    
OK, so what you have to understand is all government money is absolute horseshit, it’s not sustainable in the least bit, and it’s a fucking Ponzi scheme for those connected to the counterfeiters. that shouldn’t be controversial at all. Everybody fucking knows it. what we’re doing is building a new Global digital money, which is completely neutral and can’t be corrupted by human beings. and because of that society will flourish. The money is so good that everyone will voluntarily use it, and it will win by default while everything else crashes. bitcoin was designed based on the Austrian economic sound money principle, it fixes all the problems with gold, which, by the way, was voluntarily chosen by every society on earth independently of one another for over 5 thousand years. bitcoin is the best money in history and I don’t care if you buy any, I’m gonna use it along with hundreds of millions of other people in the global bitcoin economy.

28. Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century and beyond
29. It's money for a type 1 civilization
    -   
        
30. It's the hardest asset that has ever been or will ever be
    - Bitcoin is sound money 32. Bitcoin is global
33. Bitcoin has one job, to securely transport value, it does this with a timechain that can't be stopped
34. **Money came before writing
    - Money is one of the oldest technologies ever
    - In fact it's so old, the first forms of writing were actually ledgers of who owed what to who
    - You could make the case that money brought about the invention of writing
    - That's how important it is to civilization

**Bitcoin's Monetary Properties**  
Why would anyone find value in imaginary Internet money? Well, it turns out there are several characteristics of money that most people naturally find to be valuable and bitcoin scores well in most of these categories when compared to other forms of money. Below are 5 of the most important monetary properties.
 \> From \<[https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/](https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/)\>  

"Bitcoin’s [monetary properties](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) are designed from the ground up to be superior to all other forms of money. It is extremely portable, perfectly scarce, highly divisible, easily verifiable, durable, fungible, and extraordinarily resistant to censorship
 
Bitcoin is pieces of super-gold flying inside an unstoppable PayPal. It is the best money we ever had.
 
Bitcoin is the [people’s money](https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1245205778849394688?s=20): for the people, by the people. Not controlled by anyone; auditable and useable by everyone.
 
scarcity has value. However, as a store of value, Bitcoin is superior to land (and gold, for that matter) in many ways. No other asset can be magically beamed across the internet or other communication channels. Bitcoin has the highest value density of all assets since it is pure information. You could have a billion dollars worth of bitcoin in your head, retaining your wealth even if stripped naked
 50. Bitcoin - Its everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers. - John Oliver
51. If the internet was a country, bitcoin would be its dollar
    - Or if the internet was a whole new planet, bitcoin would be its gold
52. Unfuckwithable money
53. Bitcoin solves problems with gold, verification, transportation, divisibility
    - These shortcomings of gold led to the proliferation of banks and therefore fractional reserve banking, where the numbers in your bank account are all fake and it's all loaned out to other people
54. Bitcoin has the same ownership guarantee as sleeping with a gold bar under your pillow   
57. Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application
58. Explaining bitcoin's hardness
    - Bitcoin is impossible to make more of, or to mine faster
    - It has a fixed schedule and it's inflation rate is falling
    - Stock to flow
      
     
OK so what, just because they invented a better money doesn't mean everyone will use it  
Look at Esperanto, the language that was designed to be the easiest language on earth to learn, but the network effects of existing language were too great and no one used it  
Won't that be the case with bitcoin? The existing network effects of the dollar, gold, and all other fiat currencies are extremely strong.
 
Well so far bitcoin has been adopted at the same rate of the internet, and now constitutes a network of over 150 million people, larger than the country of Russia. So already bitcoin is growing exponentially
 
The difference is that number go up is one hell of a drug. Bitcoin was designed with financial incentive feedback loops, it's a deflationary currency, and rewards people who buy and hold it, further limiting the supply and driving up the price. Now that the wheels have started to spin, it's very hard to stop the cycle.
   

[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-single-best-shot-at-liberty](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-single-best-shot-at-liberty)  
Bitcoin already empowers millions, and not just the rich elites with existing access to banks, stock markets, and other financial technologies. Bitcoin empowers the billions of people who are unbanked and promises a future that takes control of money away from the government. Bitcoin appeals to millions of people and every person joining the Bitcoin network will have the incentive to attract more users.
   

**Saylor**  
Dematerialize property in cyberspace  
Dematerialized gold like apple dematerialized your camera, and facebook dematerialized your photos and google demateralized your library
 
BTC is digital property  
Bitcoin is digital gold  
That means it's faster, I can move it a thousand places in a couple of seconds  
It's stronger, I can pledge a hundred million dollars in it to Japan on a Saturday afternoon  
It's smarter, I can write a computer program that will slice it into a million pieces and do complicated things with it  
It's only going to get better every year forever because it's software, and what that means is that people that are attracted to apple, google facebook, because they're stronger faster smarter networks, they're going to be attracted to bitcoin
 
Bitcoin is the best security, and the most liquid security, ever invented in the history of the world, there's never been a security, you can liquidate dollars into yen on a Saturday afternoon, you can't sell gold, apple, microsoft, facebook on a Saturday afternoon,  
With bitcoin you can get a bid on it, in any currency, any hour of the day, any day 365 days a year, which means you can market to market at all times, we've never in the history of the world had a liquid security which you could market to market everywhere on earth every minute of the day through holidays, and that's what makes it a pristine asset
 
For the first time in the history of humanity  
And we dematerialized the concept of property in a decentralized network  
In such a way that you could move digital property from device to device in a friction free fashion  
And you can build a 21st centry economy in cyberspace that's beyond the reach of a company, a CEO or a government  
So that idea that you needed a decentralized monetary network to create digital property,  
Satoshi invented that around 2009 when the mobile wave flickered  
Looking back, it's the most disruptive force on the planet  
The most important thing the human race has stumbled on in the 21st centruy
 
The hardest money ever created is here  
Absolutely scarcity is here  
We are separating money from state  
And we’re entering a period of financial freedom that we’ve never known before  
True individual sovereignty  
Number go up game theory  
Alters the security and enforcement of private property  
It’s an extremely liquid, scarce, programmable, optimizable, decentralized digital asset that can be integrated into the internet of things and automation in ways that haven’t even been invented yet
       
Gary Vee  
There was a time when people traded rocks, government money is not a forever thing, and money has been reinvented several times over thousands of years
   

- The code of life is written into an organism at its inception. Satoshi carefully architected Bitcoin’s DNA, or genetic code, to be the best sound money ever created.
- The key attribute that makes Bitcoin valuable for illicit activities is that it is “permissionless” at the network level. When bitcoins are transmitted on the Bitcoin network, there is no human intervention deciding whether the transaction should be allowed. As a distributed peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin is, by its very nature, designed to be censorship-resistant.
- Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, it is usable by anyone/anywhere/anytime. Developers can freely program applications on top of the Bitcoin protocol without having to ask anyone for permission.
- “It is dynamic, upgradable and extendable. It does not need throwing out and replacing with each new iteration, it will continuously improve.” — Neil Woodfine

How old is money as a technology? It's not thousands of years old, its hundreds of thousands of years old  
In all this time we've seen 4 major changes in the underlying form of money, (from physical objects like beads and feathers, to precious metals, then we start seeing paper money which is an abstraction of the previous metals, then in the 1920's and 30s we gave up on the precious metal part and went just to paper, and then in 2008 bitcoin happened.  
A lot of people will look at bitcoin and say "It's just a payment network, it's a currency, it's not really that big of a transformation" But that would be a mistake, bitcoin is a fundamental transformation of every aspect of money, it is the most abstract form of money we created
 
The name is terrible, it has the word coin in it and a coin is the most physical form of money possible and Bitcoin is the least physical form of money, and so that can be confusing
   

Like gold, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are scarce resources that can’t be counterfeited or devalued by a government seeking to reduce its debt load.

\> From \<[https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-bitcoin#section-how-can-i-use-bitcoin](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-bitcoin#section-how-can-i-use-bitcoin)\>   
Yes, billionaires and dictators can buy a lot of bitcoin, but they cannot control the system as they can with fiat money. Unlike with the dollar, euro or yuan model, they cannot tweak issuance, censor transactions, make special rules or bailouts for the aristocracy, or perform mass remote confiscation or debasement.
 \> From \<[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom)\>      
Bitcoin is out-competing its analog predecessors on the basis of its monetary properties. Bitcoin is finitely scarce, and it is more easily divisible and more easily transferable than its incumbent competitors. It is also more decentralized, and as a derivative, more resistant to censorship or corruption. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and each bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal points (1 one-hundred millionth). Value can be transferred to anyone and anywhere in the world on a permissionless basis, and final settlement does not rely on any third-party. In aggregate, its monetary properties are vastly superior to any other form of money used today.

[https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoins-fundamental-value-is-that-it-is-the-most-excellent-money-that-exists-24be5e1d6b98](https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/bitcoins-fundamental-value-is-that-it-is-the-most-excellent-money-that-exists-24be5e1d6b98)  
Storage for future use — The ability to store bitcoins is superior to any other good. Bitcoins can be stored for future exchange indefinitely and inexpensively, and in multiple ways and locations simultaneously. (Try storing an actual consumable good in two places at the same time — it can’t be done.);  
Protection from thievery and seizure — Bitcoins, when stored in one’s own self-custody with appropriate safety considerations cannot be stolen or seized, either by physical force, through the application of ‘hacking’ skills, or by brute force computing power. They can only be surrendered. This is different from any other monetary good in existence, any of which can be taken by force without being surrendered by its rightful owner;  
Divisibility, Purity & Authenticity — Bitcoins’ digital nature makes their divisibility easier than any good that could actually be consumed. When dividing and recombining bitcoins, no dilution or impurity occurs. Bitcoins are always 100% pure bitcoin;  
Transportability — Bitcoins’ digital nature means they can be exchanged across any two physical points connected to the digital network, which is currently practically every point on Earth. (Yes there’s also offline ways to exchange bitcoins, but they’re irrelevant to this argument);  
Speed of exchange — Bitcoins’ digital nature means they can be exchanged quickly, even instantly through 2nd layers;  
Indisputability of an exchange — Bitcoins’ cryptographic ownership nature makes exchanges of bitcoin indisputable and final (eliminating the cost and risk of legal disputes);  
Indisputability of provenance (historic record of exchange) — Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain also means that its whole history of all exchanges of bitcoins is indisputable; and finally  
Scarcity — Bitcoin’s digital nature and enforced supply cap ensures bitcoins’ exchangeability is never diluted.  
Conclusion 2: Bitcoin resolves many of the age-old problems of exchange with all previous forms of money, those being:
 
2.1) Bitcoins cannot be counterfeited (based on Premise 3 points 3, 6 and 7);
 
2.2) Bitcoins cannot be stolen. (Based on premise 3 point 2);
 
2.3) The supply of bitcoins cannot be inflated. (Based on premise 3 point 8);
 
2–4) Bitcoins can be transported anywhere and settled quickly (based on Premise 3 point 5, 6 and 7); and
 
2–5) Bitcoins will never lose their ability to be exchanged. (based on premise 3 point 1 and 8)
 
Conclusion 3: It follows that bitcoins, being better goods to exchange than anything that has ever come before (premise 3), while also resolving the weaknesses of all other monies that came before before (conclusion 2), are therefore the most excellent good for exchange known. Bitcoins are thus the most excellent money known according to Premise 1’s definition of money being “a good that people value for the mere prospect of later exchanging without having consumed it, or, in other words, for its exchange-value.”
 
Thus, Bitcoin is not just money, it is the most excellent money there is.

Conclusion:
    
*need to end with a cliff hanger  
How can we know bitcoin can be trusted? What if the founder comes back and steals everyones money?  
Isn't bitcoin basically like kohls cash?  
OK just because you say that it's good as fuck and it has all of these attributes, what if no one gives a shit and keeps using dollars, since they are legal  
I could go into so many questions at the end of each episode to get people thinking  
And by asking these questions I basically am assuring the audience that all of these concerns are mute and will be addressed in the series
       
All bitcoin is,  
is fake money  
Why does it have any value at all?  
Anyone can literally just make up their own money  
I could print a ton of monopoly dollars and start selling them to people saying something like, "trust me it'll be really valuable someday!!!!"  
but because the only thing you can do with it is trade it to someone else, how can you tell if it really does anything?  
Because it's not legal tender, just make it any less fake  
And the greater idiot comes along someday and you can sell it to them, getting it off your hands and making a killing by being an early adopter  
Then these idiots are caught with the bag of fake coins, that don't actually do anything  
They paid all of this money, for some collectable thing, because someone else said it was "the new money of the world" or some bullshit and you believed him
 
Growth has been more than the internet  
Hash rate and electric usage  
All of these financial institutions jumping on board  
The bitcoin ETF being the second highest traded etf ever on its release day  
Politicians statements, corporate treasuries, country’s making laws  
Country adoption  
It’s got thousands of developers worldwide, who have been diligently working on satoshis work and mission, of a money outside the control of the government  
There are incredibly smart people working on the bitcoin project, all over the globe  
Without the internet, this kind of global coordination on decentralized money protocol would be impossible  
They are making a system capable of scaling to the entire world, and completely anonymous and untraceable digital payments  
And this freedom money just so happens to be a monetary revolution in terms of settlement and permissibility. It’s a better money, that’s controlled by no one
 
And the system was built on economic game theory, to keep the asset going up in price forever
                              
\> From \<[https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/](https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/)\>           

And what is money?  
Money is a language, a linguistic abstraction, that we use to communicate value to each other.  
Money simply allows us to express value which may have economic consequences,  
but it also has other consequences.  
We use money to express and create social bonds, relationships, associations, and organizations.  
Bitcoin is the first system of money that is not controlled by any [single] entity, that is completely decentralized.  
It introduces the very same [effects] that the internet brought to communication.  
If money is speech, if money is a language, and you disconnect it from all other media...  
to make it pure speech, pure content, an internet content type, a protocol designation, money over IP.  
It completely separates it from all previous notions of nations, sovereign issuers, institutions that control.  
We [transition] from institution-based money to a network-based money.

**First explain what money is
   

- THEY INVENTED A BETTER MONEY
    - Who does that??
    - **Designed Money** ==- Bitcoin was created to fit all the== ==fundamental properties of money== ==better than gold or fiat==
    -   
        
    - BITCOIN IS THE SEPARATION OF MONEY AND STATE
    - Bitcoin is the invention of a new digital money, it solves a decades old computer science dilemma, and is the invention of digital scarcity
    - If you look at all the attributes of a good money, bitcoin is superior in every way
    - The tipping point is behind us, the world has already started adopting and there's no going back
    - With adoption growing faster than the internet, and a HODL population of over 150MM
    - Adoption will smooth over its volatility, its programmability will keep it improving, and it’s foundation on sound money principles will make it unstoppable
- [John Nash ideal money](John%20Nash%20Ideal%20Money.md)
    -   
        
- Bitcoin is the hardest, soundest, and most perfect money ever developed by mankind
- Bitcoin isn't just money, it's isn't just a digital asset, it's also a network
    - It's an internet protocol, and a technology stack
    - it's a global monetary system and a global financial system
 
Gold was independently chosen by every society as money for thousands of years due to it's inherent monetary properties. Bitcoin improves on all of gold's qualities, making it the best money in human history. It will be chosen voluntarily by the market because of it's superiority.
   

You wouldn't want money to be run like the DMV. The state ruins everything it touches.  
One of the very few topics that all economists actually agree on is that price controls are stupid. It leads to shortages and misallocated resources EVERY TIME ITS TRIED there are thousands of examples. Thousands.  
AND YET for some reason, everyone thinks the most important financial asset in the global financial system, money, should be managed by the state.  
Do you really want bankers manipulating the price of money, AKA the price of time for every human on earth…  
AND YET no one stops to think that MAYBE price controls on money, maybe just maybe, are AS ineffective as price controls on everything else that they're tried on.  
All of our money is controlled by the state. And you better believe they manipulate and weaponize it, corrupt it and give hand outs to the elite and well connected. False price signals in interest rates cause the boom and bust cycles of our economy and the buildup of unsustainable debt.  
Bitcoin is about more than just being the best money ever made, it's a protest against the socialism that exists at the heart of our global financial system.
   

*****I have to spend some time her talking about WHAT IS MONEY and why it's important, then go into how Bitcoin is better money
 
It is also worth noting that just like other monetary goods, bitcoin is not a company, it doesn’t pay a dividend or have cash flows. Therefore, its value must be derived from its ability to better fulfill the characteristics of a monetary good compared to traditional alternatives.
   

With a digital asset like bitcoin, it doesn’t require the use of a payment processor, a bank, or a government to transfer value. For large purchases, instead of using a bank as a middleman and paying its fees, you can securely send funds to anyone all over the world, like you would an email.

\> From \<[https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-bitcoin#section-bitcoin-is-a-virtual-currency](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-bitcoin#section-bitcoin-is-a-virtual-currency)\>   
It enables cryptographically secure, censorship resistant payments across borders. It is the first and only form of absolute digital scarcity and is not controlled by any one person or group. As a result it cannot be interfered with by any world government.

\> From \<[https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/common/](https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/common/)\>   - Bitcoin was created by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto   
- Bitcoin is the introduction of a totally neutral, independent money to the world economic stage, right now it's small but in the coming years it will be a major world player. What does that look like when you have all inflationary global fiat monies and this one super sound deflationary money that financially incentivizes savings? The black hole of a perfectly scarce monetary good will absorb value as it gets built out.
- You don't understand…they've created the hardest money of all time….hard money is always superior to soft money, over time there's no escaping the incentives. Bitcoin isn't an if but a when.    
Bitcoin is so good you don't believe it at first.  
It's not too good to be true though, there are certainly tradeoffs. The more you learn about bitcoin's design tradeoffs though, the more sure you can be of it's value proposition. That's what makes it even better, that it really is amazing in unique ways with transparent and known tradeoffs.
