1. Bitcoin is one of a kind and has no competition
    1. Eth killers vs btc killers
    2. Some even argue that bitcoin and crypto aren't the same thing, bitcoin has been number one since its inception, and since all of the ICO failures of 2017, no one tries to compete anymore, Bitcoin's network effect is too strong, and it's become more of a 'if you can't beat them join them' kind of situation
    3. Bitcoin is less like myspace or AOL, and more like the internet itself
    4. Anyone who is in crypto knows that bitcoin is one of a kind, sure there are stablecoins for less volitility, and faster transaction coins for a better medium of exchange, but these aren't trying to compete, they're different value props
    5. Other crypto's are PoS, or they're straight up scams
    6. Other crypto's aren't even trying to compete with bitcoin, bitcoin IS the money
    7. Bitcoin's competition is actual gold, and fiat currencies, and CBDC's, all of which are flawed
    8. The world would prefer neutral bitcoin to chinese cbdc yuan
    9. Once you understand that bitcoin is the best money ever created, it has no competition, and no facebook crypto is coming along to defeat myspace bitcoin, you will start to realize that bitcoin is unique
    10. “One of the biggest reasons is that any improvement in one characteristic of bitcoin, such as improving its speed or scalability, leads to a reduction in another characteristic, such as bitcoin’s level of decentralization or security. This tradeoff is known as the blockchain trilemma.” -Fidelity paper

We won the culture war. Everyone refers to bitcoin AND crypto now as two separate things. It's crazy I literally see it everywhere.
       

No one is trying to compete with bitcoin anymore, I've heard that thrown around, bitcoin is the money, it's the decentralized one, and other crypto projects have moved on, and are focused on the other 'ten thousand' blockchain use cases.  
Bitcoin is the 'digital gold' store of value because of its security, and it's network.  
If you know the crypto space, you know that bitcoin is uncontested.  
Bitcoin is the currency.  
And if bitcoin is the currency - then shit is gonna hit the fan.  
It's pretty much a guarantee at this point, and that’s why I'm so giddy about it  
It's not that it's gonna go up in price, yes that's true but it's a byproduct for what is really going on.  
That's what people really need to understand, it's a money that's out of control
   
- Bitcoin has no competition

It’s only even close comparison is gold, but bitcoin is far superior  
It has no rivals in its quest for digital gold either, all direct competitors have failed to keep up, and the crypto space has moved on to other projects, it’s well established that bitcoin IS the money protocol. All other tokens are utility tokens, and have an ulterior purpose. This makes bitcoin the most neutral and therefore, soundest money, in history

- The privilege of creating and controlling your own money, never mind a monopoly on it, is something that gives the controllers of that system an incredible amount of power
    - Every coin that has come after bitcoin has needed a marketing team, a pre-mine, an ICO, and has been classified as a security
    - It's impossible to replicate bitcoin's neutrality
- …privacy coins or coins with more programmability etcetera etc they really don't stand a lot of they don't stand a chance against Bitcoin at this point in time because I believe people will soon realize the truth and the truth is that the value and aka the price is determined by the monetary premium and the monetary premia is determined by a combination of the current monetary Network effects monetary liquidity sale ability marketability recognizability The Linde effect and most first and foremost the credibility of the monetary policy and just the general trust and in all of these term **in all of these criteria bitcoin is so far ahead than everything else** that the way I see it yes there there may be two or three more sort of mini alt coin bubbles particularly as more people sort of enter into the space there's a natural sort of incentive to sort of find the next big thing of course but I believe that once Bitcoin

goes above several trillion dollars or so a big divergence will happen and really all the other cryptocurrencies

- what you're saying is if somebody wants to compete against Bitcoin right another project you can't beat it on security today right because of the network effect and then you can't beat it on the monetary policy and therefore you have to go to other areas in which you may be able to build a competitive advantage
    - that is most of the thinking in in sort of eloquent Creators heads…it might work at first but is doomed to fail

Bitcoin’s value is driven by its enforceable scarcity  
One of the greatest characteristics of bitcoin’s properties is its scarcity. Not only is bitcoin scarce  
(bitcoin’s current inflation rate of 1.8% is roughly equal to gold’s inflation rate at the moment)  
unlike gold it is also provably finite. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. No other digital asset  
possesses an immutable monetary policy on the level of bitcoin. In other words, bitcoin’s monetary  
policy may be viewed as the most credible.  
…  
Why we believe bitcoin has the potential to be the primary monetary good:  
Investors may agree that bitcoin possesses many of the qualities that make for good money, but who is  
to say that only one monetary good can or will exist?  
We won’t be so bold as to predict there will only ever be one money, but we do believe that one monetary  
good will come to dominant the digital asset ecosystem due to the very powerful effects of networks.  
Monetary network effects are extremely powerful  
Many investors are familiar with the power of network effects, where the value of a given network  
increases exponentially as the number of its users grows. Monetary networks are no different.
 
…  
In this report, Fidelity got a lot of things right: bitcoin being considered separate from crypto, the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) showing that Bitcoin grows stronger by the day, the network’s enforceable scarcity as a highlight, why Bitcoin can’t be supplanted, struggles Bitcoin has endured, presenting bitcoin as a starting point for digital portfolios and the risks associated.

         - A blockchain is only interesting if it's immutable, otherwise it's just an inefficient database. What if I told you that there is only one immutable blockchain in existence?

- Unlike every other cryptocurrency, there is no central point of failure. Bitcoin has no Vitalik Buterin, no Ethereum Foundation, no Deltec bank like Tether, no fancy offices in San Francisco, no team of lawyers, no governance token, no VC-backing, no pre-mine, no small council, and no whales able to manipulate the system. This decentralized architecture has already insulated Bitcoin from attacks at the highest levels. No matter how much Bitcoin you own, you can’t change the rules, print more, censor, steal or prevent others from using the network.

- Because of bitcoin's network effect, programmability, and superior monetary policy, direct alternatives have slowly faded away in importance. Bitcoin's shortcomings have been accounted for within the bitcoin ecosystem, (scalability lightning/liquid, privacy lighting/taproot, interoperability wallets/exchanges, energy usage mining council/education)
- It's now commonly understood that bitcoin is built for one thing, incorruptible value storage, and other crypto projects have moved on to other use cases
- It's notable however that while future use cases for distributed cryptographic ledgers are vast and interesting, **the use case for a superior monetary asset is by far the largest and most disruptive on a global scale**
    - When you realize Bitcoin is about fixing capitalism, crypto, NFT's, Metaverse, gaming, web3 and defi all pale in comparison
    - Its fine that people focus on other projects, no one can replace bitcoin

    - As an open-source software protocol, it has always been possible to copy Bitcoin’s software and imitate its network. Over the years, many imitators have been created, ranging from ersatz facsimiles, such as Litecoin, to complex variants like Ethereum that promise to allow arbitrarily complex contractual arrangements using a distributed computational system. A common investment criticism of Bitcoin is that it cannot maintain its value when competitors can be easily created that are able to incorporate the latest innovations and software features.
    - The fallacy in this argument is that the scores of Bitcoin competitors that have been created over the years lack the “network effect” of the first and dominant technology in the space. A network effect — the increased value of using Bitcoin simply because it is already the dominant network — is a feature in and of itself. For any technology that possesses a network effect, it is by far the most important feature.
    - The network effect for Bitcoin encompasses the liquidity of its market, the number of people who own it, and the community of developers maintaining and improving upon its software and its brand awareness. Large investors, including nation-states, will seek the most liquid market so that they can enter and exit the market quickly without affecting its price. Developers will flock to the dominant development community which has the highest-calibre talent, thereby reinforcing the strength of that community. And brand awareness is self-reinforcing, as would-be competitors to Bitcoin are always mentioned in the context of Bitcoin itself.

Maybe there’s something over there I don’t care that’s not really the point  
I don’t have the time to go through 10,000 scams to find the one thing that might be a viable project at some point, I don’t care it can’t be that good  
The money itself, sound secure, independent, decentralized money, is the biggest problem we have, who cares, who cares if there’s some crypto token With some utility in god knows what, if I’m wrong and bananas on the blockchain is a real thing I could give a shit if I missed out on that investment
      

**GC take  
Bitcoin and everything else are so mutually exclusive that I don't even call myself a Maxi, there's no point, I'm just a bitcoiner. Bitcoin has already won, it is the money. The money problem is so important, the world needs a decentralized, perfectly scarce, immutable, independent, permissionless, and unstoppable value transfer protocol, and no other project is competing with bitcoin on that. And maybe they're right, maybe banana's on the blockchain will be extremely important someday, especially in countries with no legal systems or private property protections, but the other use cases for digital assets are so inconceivably minor when compared to our over financialized, consumerist, inflation ridden, debt bubble, and surveillance state world, that I don't even bother wasting my energy on other projects. Even trying to learn them, what's important, and what's a scam, is just too much for me. I'm actually excited about the ethos of a decentralized future, and I'll be happy when legitimate projects take off and obsolete existing institutional power structures, but it's far too early and I'm waiting for the dust to settle. I'm not a gambler and I don't know enough about the space. And to be honest I'm not even gonna have fomo if I missed out on 10 thousand x gains, I'll be fine holding the most pristine collateral the world has ever known.
       
**Who are Bitcoin's competitors in the race for the global reserve currency?**
 
Weaknesses of the U.S. Dollar  
"The fundamental weakness of the U.S. dollar is that it is only valuable through government fiat. This weakness is shared by every other major national currency in the world and is perceived as normal in the modern age. However, as recently as the 1970s, it was considered a somewhat radical proposition. Without the discipline imposed by a commodity-based currency standard (such as gold), the worry is that governments might print too much money for political purposes or to conduct wars."
 
"In fact, one reason the IMF was formed was to monitor the Federal Reserve and its commitment to Bretton Woods.12﻿ Today, the IMF uses the other reserves as a discipline on Fed activity.10﻿ If foreign governments or investors decided to switch away from the U.S. dollar en masse, the flood of short positions could significantly hurt anyone with assets denominated in dollars."
 
"If the Federal Reserve creates money and the U.S. government assumes and monetizes debt faster than the U.S. economy grows, the future value of the currency could fall in absolute terms. Fortunately for the United States, virtually every alternative currency is backed by similar economic policies. Even if the dollar faltered in absolute terms, it may still be stronger globally, due to its strength relative to the alternatives."
 
WOW this article is amazing! It tries to argue that the dollar won't collapse, but really just makes me even more convinced that it will
 
Bitcoin is a worst case scenario for the IMF, if it succeeds, it could actually be deemed a threat to global stability

**you just go down a notch and the whole proposition is totally different** you're talking about smart contracts platforms you're talking about you know speed of your networks that compromise on security like you have to make a lot more decisions whereas I feel like I mean I came into Bitcoin as a result of some dissatisfaction with

56. Bitcoin is also intertwined in the crypto universe, metaverse, etc. It is the digital gold, the reserve asset for the internet and for meatspace, other cryptos are utility tokens,
    1. Money is a winner take all system, the game theory is towards a shelling point, the coincidence of wants makes it burdensome to have a barter system of 10 thousand different currencies. Having native tokens for each and every crypto use case will prove to be disastrous for the industry, and the only long term sustainable projects will leverage the most pristine value storage asset ever created.

Former head of Meta’s cryptocurrency and fintech unit and co-founder of Diem, David Marcus, took to Twitter on Tuesday to vocalize his support for Bitcoin, predicting that it will be the “one asset and L1 still around in 20+ years.” Marcus spent years working on Meta’s Diem, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, before stepping down from his position late last year.

When someone asks, “can’t you just copy Bitcoin?”, that’s why the answer is “no”. You can replicate the open source code, but you can’t replicate the fact that millions of ASIC miners are securing the Bitcoin network and not your copycat network, you can’t replicate the fact that tens of thousands of full nodes are ensuring consensus, and you can’t replicate the fact that thousands of developers are working on making the Bitcoin network better every day rather than working on your copycat network. And Bitcoin’s second layer, Lightning, has a lot of open channels and liquidity that can’t be easily replicated either; it took years to build.  
Trying to copy Bitcoin would be like if I copied the content from Wikipedia and hosted it on my website. Technically it could be done, but it wouldn’t do much. It wouldn’t gain the real Wikipedia’s traffic, because it wouldn’t have the hundreds of millions of links pointing to it from other websites. And it wouldn’t be updated like the real Wikipedia, because there’s no way I could convince the majority of those volunteer editors to come work on my version instead. Unless I could somehow succeed in the herculean task of convincing the majority of the network to move over to my version, it would always just be a shadow of the real one with a tiny fraction of the value.

Because bitcoin is fully transparent and open source, other cryptocurrencies replicated bitcoin's code in attempts to improve on the tradeoffs of the protocol, some took bitcoin's scripting capabilities to create programmable and automated smart contracts and decentralized applications, while others replicated bitcoin's invention of digital scarcity to create land, art, and economies within cyberspace.

It has the best network effects, the highest liquidity, and the highest security by many orders of magnitude. Nothing else comes close, and I don’t want to waste any digital ink naming any other coin. All I will say about Bitcoin’s copy-cats is this: do not touch them. While the Siren’s song of shitcoins is hard to resist, they are called shitcoins for a reason. Bitcoin can’t be copied. It is a path-dependent-invention in a winner-takes-all environment.

"Currency collapses are caused by a lack of faith in the stability or usefulness of money—either as a way to store value or as a medium of exchange. As soon as users stop believing that a currency is useful, that currency is in trouble. This can be brought about through improper valuations or pegging, chronic low growth, or inflation."
 
"The U.S. dollar is not the only reserve currency in the world, though it is the most prevalent. As of October 2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved four other reserve currencies: the euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan.10﻿ It is important that the dollar has competitors as an international reserve currency because it creates a theoretical alternative for the rest of the world in case American policymakers lead the dollar down a damaging path."

Despite the emergence of other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most popular and widely adopted digital currency in the world. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including Bitcoin's network effect, superior monetary policy, and decentralized architecture, which make it an unbeatable force in the cryptocurrency market.  
- [ ] Because of Bitcoin's network effect, programmability, and superior monetary policy, direct alternatives have slowly faded away in importance. Bitcoin's shortcomings have been accounted for within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as scalability lightning/liquid, privacy lighting/taproot, interoperability wallets/exchanges, and energy usage mining council/education. It's now commonly understood that Bitcoin is built for one thing, incorruptible value storage, and other crypto projects have moved on to other use cases.
 
- [x] One of the biggest debates in the cryptocurrency space is between Eth killers and btc killers. Eth killers, such as Cardano and Solana, seek to replace Ethereum as the go-to platform for decentralized applications, while btc killers, such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, aim to dethrone Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency. However, despite the emergence of these projects, Bitcoin's dominance remains unchallenged. This is because Bitcoin has been the number one cryptocurrency since its inception, and since the ICO failures of 2017, no one has been able to compete with its network effect.  
- [ ] Many new cryptocurrencies emerge each year, claiming to be Bitcoin's competitors. However, most of them fall into two categories: Ethereum killers and Bitcoin killers. Ethereum killers are new blockchains designed to outperform Ethereum in terms of scalability, functionality, and smart contract capabilities. They are not direct competitors to Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin killers are new cryptocurrencies that aim to replace Bitcoin as the world's dominant cryptocurrency. However, most of these Bitcoin killers have failed, and Bitcoin remains the king.
 
- [x] Bitcoin is less like Myspace or AOL, and more like the internet itself. While other cryptocurrencies come and go, Bitcoin remains the most stable and secure digital currency in the market. This is because Bitcoin has a decentralized architecture that makes it impossible to manipulate or control. Additionally, Bitcoin's network effect is too strong for any other cryptocurrency to challenge.  
- [ ] Many people compare Bitcoin to Myspace or AOL, which were once dominant in their respective fields but eventually lost their dominance. However, Bitcoin is less like Myspace or AOL and more like the internet itself. The internet is an open network that allows anyone to build on top of it and create new applications. Similarly, Bitcoin is an open network that allows anyone to build on top of it and create new applications.
 
- [x] Anyone who is in crypto knows that Bitcoin is one of a kind. Sure, there are stablecoins for less volatility, and faster transaction coins for a better medium of exchange, but these aren't trying to compete. They have different value propositions. Other cryptocurrencies are PoS or straight up scams, and they aren't even trying to compete with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the money.  
- [ ] Since the initial coin offering (ICO) failures of 2017, no cryptocurrency has emerged that can compete with Bitcoin's network effect. The network effect is a phenomenon where a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it. Bitcoin's network effect is strong, and it has become a "if you can't beat them, join them" situation for many cryptocurrencies. Instead of trying to compete with Bitcoin, many new cryptocurrencies are built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain, using it as a foundation.  
- [ ] Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and is built for one thing: incorruptible value storage. Other cryptocurrencies have different value propositions, such as faster transactions or more stable prices. However, these cryptocurrencies are not trying to compete with Bitcoin; they are offering different solutions to different problems. For example, stablecoins offer less volatility, and faster transaction coins offer a better medium of exchange.
 
- [x] Bitcoin's competition is actual gold, fiat currencies, and CBDC's, all of which are flawed. While gold has been used as a store of value for centuries, it is not easily transferable or divisible. Fiat currencies are subject to inflation and government manipulation, and CBDC's are centralized and subject to government control. The world would prefer neutral Bitcoin to Chinese CBDC Yuan.  
- [ ] Bitcoin's competition is not other cryptocurrencies but actual gold, fiat currencies, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years, but it has several limitations, such as storage and transport costs. Fiat currencies are subject to inflation and government manipulation. CBDCs are a new form of digital currency that is controlled by central banks, and their effectiveness is still untested.
 
- [x] One of the biggest reasons why Bitcoin has no competition is that any improvement in one characteristic of Bitcoin, such as improving its speed or scalability, leads to a reduction in another characteristic, such as Bitcoin's level of decentralization or security. This tradeoff is known as the blockchain trilemma, and it is something that has yet to be overcome by any other cryptocurrency.
 
- [x] Bitcoin has the highest liquidity of all cryptocurrencies, meaning that it is the easiest cryptocurrency to buy and sell. Additionally, Bitcoin has the greatest number of users amongst all cryptocurrencies, giving it the largest network effects. This means that as more people adopt Bitcoin, its value will continue to increase.
 
- [x] Unlike every other cryptocurrency, there is no central point of failure with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has no Vitalik Buterin, no Ethereum Foundation, no Deltec bank like Tether, no fancy offices in San Francisco, no team of lawyers, no governance token, no VC-backing, no pre-mine, no small council, and no whales able to manipulate the system. This decentralized architecture has already insulated Bitcoin from attacks at the highest levels. No matter how much Bitcoin you own, you can’t change the rules, print more, censor, steal or prevent others from using the network.  
- [ ] Many new cryptocurrencies claim to have improved on Bitcoin's design by using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism instead of Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. However, PoS is untested at scale, and it is unclear whether it can provide the same level of security as PoW. Additionally, many new cryptocurrencies are straight up scams, preying on people's FOMO (fear of missing out) and taking their money without delivering any real value.

- [x] Bitcoin is often hailed as the king of cryptocurrencies, and there are several reasons why it is considered one-of-a-kind and without any competition. From its inception to its current status, Bitcoin has weathered many challenges, including the emergence of new cryptocurrencies and their potential to surpass Bitcoin's dominance. However, Bitcoin has remained the undisputed champion of the cryptocurrency world. In this article, we will discuss why Bitcoin is one of a kind and doesn't have any competition.

Its proof-of-work consensus mechanism has been battle-tested for over a decade and has proven to be incredibly resilient against attacks. In contrast, many other blockchain projects use untested or experimental consensus mechanisms that are prone to vulnerabilities and exploits.

Bitcoin has the largest developer ecosystem of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of developers working on its core protocol and a vast array of third-party applications and services being built on top of it. This ensures that the Bitcoin network will continue to evolve and improve over time.
 
- [ ] p. Bitcoin has the potential to become a global reserve currency, much like gold was in the past. It's decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies that are subject to inflation and political interference.
 
- [ ] q. Bitcoin is the most widely recognized and accepted cryptocurrency, with a growing number of merchants and businesses accepting it as a form of payment. This trend is likely to continue as more people become familiar with Bitcoin and its benefits.
 
- [ ] r. Bitcoin's open and transparent ledger provides unprecedented levels of accountability and auditability, making it an ideal platform for businesses and governments to conduct transactions and manage their finances.
 
- [ ] s. Bitcoin is a truly global currency, with no barriers to entry or restrictions on who can use it. This makes it an ideal platform for cross-border transactions and international trade.
 
- [ ] t. Bitcoin has a passionate and dedicated community of users and supporters who are committed to its long-term success. This community provides a valuable source of support, development, and innovation for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
 
- [ ] o. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it a deflationary asset. This is in contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed at will by central banks, leading to inflation and a loss of purchasing power over time. Bitcoin's fixed supply, combined with its increasing demand, has led to a significant increase in its price over time.
 
- [ ] p. Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate asset by institutional investors. In recent years, large financial institutions such as Fidelity, BlackRock, and JP Morgan have entered the Bitcoin market, providing institutional-grade custody and trading services to their clients. This has led to a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, and has helped to solidify its status as a legitimate asset class.
 
- [ ] q. Bitcoin has a global reach, with users and nodes distributed all over the world. This means that Bitcoin is not subject to the whims of any single government or jurisdiction, and is truly a global currency. This makes it particularly attractive to people in countries with unstable or oppressive governments, who may not have access to traditional banking services.
 
- [ ] r. Bitcoin is becoming more user-friendly over time. While it was once difficult for the average person to buy and use Bitcoin, this is no longer the case. There are now numerous exchanges and wallets that make it easy to buy, sell, and store Bitcoin, and there are even Bitcoin debit cards that allow users to spend their Bitcoin at merchants that don't yet accept it directly.
   

- [ ] In conclusion, Bitcoin is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency that is unmatched in terms of its security, decentralization, and network effects. While other blockchain projects may have different use cases and value propositions, none of them can match Bitcoin's status as the world's premier digital asset and store of value. As more people come to realize the unique qualities that make Bitcoin so special, its value proposition is likely to become even more compelling, cementing its place as the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem for years to come.
          
- If Bitcoin is a car, blockchain is like a transmission
    - Blockchain is one component of the technology infrastructure of Bitcoin the system one component
        - It's not the most important component, nor the most revolutionary component, in fact blockchain technology pre-existed bitcoin. in fact most of the technologies used in Bitcoin had already existed.
            - Hashes hash trees cryptography public key cryptography digital signatures proof of work all of these things existed before Bitcoin the invention is to take all of these things together and leverage proof of work as a mechanism for consensus that allows us to control a blockchain in a decentralized manner when no one has cultivate control over it can you build a consensus algorithm different than proof of work yes can you build a blockchain that not decentralized and doesn't use proof-of-work
        - blockchain is not the most interesting technology in Bitcoin and this is often misunderstood.
    - Blockchain is like the transmission in your car, very important, absolutely necessary to keep moving, but no one said oh finally with the invention of the internal combustion engine in the automobile we now have the ability to build transmission based vehicles!!! nobody said "I like cars but I'm more interested in the technology behind cars transmissions" In the blockchain space a lot of people make the statements well bitcoins interesting but… "But" means I haven't understood it yet, bitcoin is interesting but I'm more interested in the technology behind Bitcoin blockchain… these newfangled automobiles are interesting BUT I'm more interested in the revolutionary technology behind automobiles pneumatic inflatable tires!!! if we could combine pneumatic inflatable tires with the steady traditional propulsion mechanism of horses we could really do something interesting LOL -Andreas

Ultimately, a blockchain is only useful in the application of money because it is dependent on a native currency for security. Bitcoin represents the most secure blockchain by orders of magnitude. Because all other blockchains are competing for the same fundamental use case of money and because bitcoin’s network effects only continue to increase its security and liquidity advantage over the field, no other digital currency can compete with bitcoin. Liquidity begets liquidity and monetary systems tend to one medium as a derivative function. Bitcoin’s security and liquidity obsoleted any other cryptocurrencies before they left the proverbial gates. Find me a cryptocurrency that comes close to bitcoin relative to security, liquidity or the credibility of its monetary properties, and I will find you a unicorn.
      

To truly commit to surrendering power, the founders of these projects must be comfortable with austerity and eventual irrelevance. It’s sometimes said that Satoshi’s second most brilliant insight, behind creating Bitcoin, was leaving the project. Lamentably, virtually no cryptocurrency founders since have followed his lead, preferring filthy lucre and a shot at joining the Davos class, alongside their fellow central bankers.
 
Of course, the disadvantage inherent in the ‘fair launch’ is the fact that it’s challenging to monetize the network, especially early on. This is fine if developers are happy to work idealistically or altruistically. In Bitcoin, patrons eventually emerged, as the network came to be systemically important. Today, a rich and diverse set of patrons subsidize dozens of core developers to keep the chain running smoothly and work on long term infrastructure. This is perhaps the ideal model; but Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first, the most critically important, and not having venture backers to reckon with. Today, any new cryptocurrency struggles to distinguish itself. Obtaining sufficient traction to survive on patronage or donations is a tall order. 
 
My central point is this: the principal challenge in the administration of a new monetary commodity is not a technical one. Of course, your blockchain must have compelling technical features. But ultimately the difficulty lies in climbing the wall of indifference. At inception, no one cares about your system. At maturity, you need tens and possibly hundreds of millions of individuals to care. If you give early investors discounted access to a significant fraction of supply, and then give them powerful anti-dilution rights (while hoping/expecting that future individuals will use your network as working capital and tolerate some dilution, in effect subsidizing the early buyers who passively stake), you risk creating a patently unfair system in which the winners are a function of the arbitrary prehistory of the chain.
 
Attracting anyone to a network like this strikes me as profoundly unlikely. Why your chain? Why not an equivalent fair launch, where every owner worked for their coins, instead of receiving an allocation through some proximity to the founding team?

**Bitcoin – not crypto**   
Venture capital firms have plowed [billions of dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/12/vc-investment-into-crypto-startups-peaked-right-before-everything-went-to-hell/#:~:text=VC%20investment%20into%20crypto%20startups%20peaked%20right%20before%20everything%20went%20to%20hell,-Alex%20Wilhelm%40alex&text=The%20first%20quarter%20was%20a,a%20host%20of%20other%20metrics.) into crypto startups in recent years, however, their scattergun approach betrays a lack of in-depth expertise and a lack of certainty about the likely winners to emerge. But amidst all the noise, bitcoin has always stood out from the crypto crowd. It is well-established and widely traded – with both [corporate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2021/02/21/even-if-bitcoin-falls-again-company-adoption-of-crypto-is-not-going-away/?sh=523745e36d52) and [sovereign adoption](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/no-matter-the-price-the-message-of-bitcoin-has-already-won) now beckoning. Notwithstanding the current dip, it has proven itself to be stable, secure, and technologically unique, over a prolonged period.
 
As [Andrew Howard](https://andsimple.co/people/andrew-howard/), Chief Business Development Officer at bitcoin brokerage firm [Bitcoin Reserve](https://andsimple.co/companies/bitcoin-reserve/), puts it, “Bitcoin is honest money. It is the most moral monetary system we have.”  
…  
But to become the monetary protocol for everything requires one further feature – the ability to determine who owns what and when, precisely, and uncontestably. Again, bitcoin’s immutable ledger stands alone in this respect. It’s a one-of-a-kind technology capable of establishing time flow (and thus, the transfer of value) in the digital realm.

Bitcoiners are here for a peaceful, monetary revolution to create a brand new society in a way that’s never been done before and without any rulers. Most people who are into cryptocurrency are here to mint some monkeys on a blockchain and make a quick buck. The more time one spends in the digital asset space, the easier it is to notice the major differences between the two groups.
    
[https://relai.app/relai-is-a-bitcoin-only-app/](https://relai.app/relai-is-a-bitcoin-only-app/)  
There are hundreds of “crypto” apps out there that enable you to trade or invest in a wide range of cryptocurrencies, from meme coins like Dogecoin to Ethereum and others. However, unlike Bitcoin, the vast majority of cryptocurrency are highly speculative and were often only created to make their founders rich.
 
Moreover, most cryptocurrencies don’t have Bitcoin’s limited supply and hard-coded disinflationary monetary policy, which means they have not been designed to increase in value as adoption and usage increase.
 
Additionally, many cryptocurrencies have specific use cases, such as acting as access tokens to use a network or as voting rights in a crypto venture’s governance process. While the technological innovation delivered by these types of crypto networks may be exciting, they don’t offer the same promising investment case that Bitcoin does.
 
That’s why Bitcoin and “crypto” are not the same. Bitcoin is a unique and ingenious savings technology while “crypto” is a highly speculative asset class marred with scams and dubious incentive structures.
 
As a company, we have made the decision to only support Bitcoin because it provides the best way for individuals to save money.
      

==After Nakamoto showed the way, there have been over fifteen thousand other cryptocurrencies created. Some of them are competitors to the bitcoin network, while others are smart contract platforms to serve other purposes. So far, all of the ones directly trying to be money have not been able to gain any traction against the bitcoin network (with none of them sustaining above 5% of the network value of bitcoin), while a select few that aim to be used as smart contract utility tokens instead have retained rather large network valuations for longer periods of time.==  
==Many people argue that bitcoin has achieved critical mass in terms of its network effect, security, immutability, and decentralization, such that while other digital assets may persist to fulfill other use-cases, none of them have a reasonable chance of competing with bitcoin in terms of being hard money==

Many altcoins regularly hard fork, which is an indicator that they have a certain level of centralization in their development and community. Other altcoins do things that simply would not be scalable if they were scaled up to the level of Bitcoin and the number of bitcoin transactions. Other altcoins do things that are more permissioned, and thus they are not an _open_ system like Bitcoin is.  

You might even argue that a specific altcoin does _one_ specific thing better than Bitcoin does, but are any of them meaningfully making improvements on the whole? I don’t think so, and that’s why Bitcoin is rightly in a category of its own. There is also the question of whether Bitcoin _should_ have these supposed other features or things, as this may also cause negative trade offs in one of the other worthwhile qualities of the system (robustness, decentralization, scalability, verifiability, etc.).

David Marcus, whose payments-focused career has included stints at PayPal and Meta, is now leading Lightspark to propel Bitcoin adoption.  
“We’ve built the unshakeable conviction at this point that the only blockchain and the only underlying assets that can support a truly open protocol for payments on the internet is Bitcoin and nothing else,” he said.
 
In 2021, Marcus left Meta and the next year he launched Lightspark to pursue that conviction.

Tim C. May on all the crypto bullshit  
The tension between privacy (or anonymity) and "know your customer" approaches is a core issue. It's "decentralized, anarchic and peer-to-peer" versus "centralized, permissioned and back door." Understand that the vision of many in the privacy community — cypherpunks, Satoshi, other pioneers — was explicitly of a permission-less, peer-to-peer system for money transfers. Some had visions of a replacement for "fiat" currency.  
Tim: Yes, there is not much of interest to many of us if cryptocurrencies just become Yet Another PayPal, just another bank transfer system. What's exciting is the bypassing of gatekeepers, of exorbitant fee collectors, of middlemen who decide whether Wikileaks — to pick a timely example — can have donations reach it. And to allow people to send money abroad.  
Attempts to be "regulatory-friendly" will likely kill the main uses for cryptocurrencies, which are NOT just "another form of PayPal or Visa."  
More general uses of "blockchain" technology are another kettle of fish. Many uses may be compliance-friendly. Of course, a lot of the proposed uses — like putting supply chain records — on various public or private blockchains are not very interesting. Many point that these "distributed ledgers" are not even new inventions, just variants of databases with backups. As well, the idea that corporations want public visibility into contracts, materials purchases, shipping dates, and so on, is naive.  
Remember, the excitement about bitcoin was mostly about bypassing controls, to enable exotic new uses like Silk Road. It was some cool and edgy stuff, not just another PayPal.  
Talk of "reputation tokens," "attention tokens," "charitable giving tokens," these all seem way premature to me. And none have taken off the way bitcoin did. Even ethereum, a majorly different approach, has yet to see interest uses
