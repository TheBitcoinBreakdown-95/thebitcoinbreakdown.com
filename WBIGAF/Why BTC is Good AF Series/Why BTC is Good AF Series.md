- My goal here is to make a series of short articles that I can make into a podcast series or video series,
    - the topics are broad enough that I could probably do an hour on each one, or just hit the fundamentals in a way that people new to Bitcoin can be overwhelmed by its awesomeness
- I have to come up with a good article length
    - I think 5 min videos are probably optimal, and if my videos are just animated versions of me reading my script then I should shoot for 700 words
- I also decided I could just compile all of my resources and read off good quotes
- ***Important to use lots of small snippits vs long ones
- I think I want to make each episode around 10-20 minutes to start
    - That way I could always go back and expand on this series later
    - It's easy for me to get episodes up and out quick
    - I have to realize there's no freakin way for me to possibly mention all of the things I could mention
    - I just want a brief overview of each of these topics for newbs to dive into
 
Maybe I shoot for 15 mins, and give myself a buffer up or down
   

**I think something that's important for me is that I have a plan to update these episodes later

- I'm gonna need to just get content out, and not worry about it being perfect
- But what will help me with that is if I go back and update the episodes later
- Maybe I don't even update every single one, but I do something where I call the episode version 2
- I'll have a sylabus on my website, and ill just update the links to the episodes, on spotify it'll be a whole hodge podge, but I'll say to listen to them in order, just go to my website
   

Forward:

- I never thought I would write a book, and the question of if I ever finish this book, or in time for everyone to catch up to my knowledge, is questionable
- I could be known as the WBIGAF guy, but really this project is a combination of proving to myself bitcoin is amazing, and acts as a place to put all of the research I've ever come across into one holistic organizational platform
- I want to include all of the reasons bitcoin is amazing, but I'm sure I'm missing some, in fact I often come to a new realization, and I realize I might never get to the bottom of this rabbit hole.
- In that effect, I'd like to keep this list flexible, sure maybe I'll publish physically but keeping it as a blog is optimal

***I know that I want to make this into a podcast, but the podcast market is oversaturated  
*If I made a youtube channel, could just be me talking, cuts to ppt presentations, or chrome tabs  
Don't have to make it crazy but I know that I have
