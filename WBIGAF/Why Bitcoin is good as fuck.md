Bitcoin solved the byzantine general's problem, it's a trust machine that requires no central party, government, bank, or corporation of any kind to manage it.  
This is a revolution.
 
Bitcoin is a peaceful revolution. It's opting out of the current - over leveraged, corrupt and statically failing - global economic system, with a digital asset that is the best savings technology in the history of mankind. No one is forced to join, it's completely voluntary. It's rules are set in stone, and its laws treat everyone equally.
 
Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin, and therefore, digital property. An invention unparalleled since the internet itself. The use cases are vast, and have already started to change the world.
 
Bitcoin is extremely decentralized, far more than any other cryptocurrency, establishing it as the first (and only) immutable ledger in history…Imagine, a way to create a record that can never be destroyed or altered, it's like a fucking golden tablet on cyberspace mountain, which can never be reached, but it can be read by all.
 
Bitcoin is extremely transparent. It's code is completely open source, meaning anyone can read or alter it. All transactions are broadcast to everyone, and you can read every transaction since the genesis block.
 
No matter your political persuasion, you can look at bitcoin and find something you agree with.  
It’s very rare that you find a technology that’s the solution to every rich person’s problem and every poor person’s problem simultaneously
 
Bitcoin democratizes money in the same way that the internet democratizes information,  
It flattens power structures and lifts all boats. Bitcoin doesn't care about your economic status, religion, gender, ethnicity, political views  
…bitcoin doesn't even care if you're a human…or a car, or a refrigerator, or a drone. Bitcoin enables automated, (and instant) value transfer, in a way that wasn't previously possible.   Bitcoin is the only totally neutral global digital money.  
It’s value add is its neutrality.  
It’s decentralized nature makes it completely unique, and it’s extremely secure  
It’s an independent third party, that has no allegiance
 
Bitcoin has no competition  
It’s only even close comparison is gold, but bitcoin is far superior  
It has no rivals in its quest for digital gold either, all direct competitors have failed to keep up, and the crypto space has moved on to other projects, it’s well established that bitcoin IS the money protocol. All other tokens are utility tokens, and have an ulterior purpose. This makes bitcoin the most neutral and therefore, soundest money, in history
 
"Running non-stop for nine years, with almost zero financial loss on the chain itself, Bitcoin has become the most reliable and secure financial network in the world. When you send a valid Bitcoin transaction, you can bet the farm on it that it will be sent and that it will be received by your intended recipient. It’s right up there with death and taxes."
 
It's pretty much guaranteed at this point, bitcoin's whole purpose is that it can't be shut down.  
I've tried so hard to find a weakness, but its security is _very literally unparalleled_  
You can create whatever forks you want, bitcoin will always exist. And there will never be more than 21 million. That kind of security guarantee is unique to both blockchains and the entire digital realm. You can use that bedrock foundation for so many things, all programmable on top of bitcoin. It's more than a coin, it's a financial system.
 
Bitcoin will not be the "money" used for every transaction but it will become the foundation that money is layered upon

We're talking a new global financial and monetary system,  
Based on rules, not rulers
 
Tacking onto the programmable money aspect, the layers of bitcoin and possibilities for it to shed its skin in case of an attack, or to add additional features and layers like The lightning network
 
This is the new gold rush, the ability to see its potential is what I've spent my whole life training and studying for  
Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century and beyond  
It's money for a type 1 civilization
 
There has been a turning point since the pandemic, bitcoin is no longer speculative, once I realized it had transitioned and there’s no going back, I have been obsessed
   

Bitcoin's case for why it's a [10x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN2X4bUzgEg) value to society is it's putting a peg to a global economy that has no peg anywhere in sight for any country

“Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. It is owned by the crowd, its users. And it has now a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.” — Nassim Nicolas Taleb
    
The hash rate is bitcoins value proposition  
It’s decentralized nature, and that it can’t ever be changed  
Bitcoin allows for instant international settlement, unstoppable and final transfers, onion routed and anonymous payments, it is unrivaled in financial mobility
 
**CBDC's are surveillance disguised as money**  
Bitcoin's censorship resistance is its value proposition  
They are the natural next step in a world with states trying to reclaim power  
Without bitcoin, without a truly invincible decentralized alternative,  
That's why it's so important, that's why bitcoin is critically important for a free future
 
Freedom money  
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-insurance-against-states](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-insurance-against-states)  
Immutable value storage via Bitcoin is our best defense against tyrannical overreaching governments.  
[https://blog.trezor.io/bitcoin-protects-your-right-to-protest-88bdef2ea1bf](https://blog.trezor.io/bitcoin-protects-your-right-to-protest-88bdef2ea1bf)  
If the state becomes corrupt, needs to prop up their failing currency, or begins sanctioning peaceful protestors with emergency measures — as happened in Canada last week — **your money could be seized without so much as a warrant.**  
Without direct control of your money, years of working and saving can be taken from you in an instant. Bitcoin is a more transparent, predictable way to protect your wealth or raise money for a cause, as long as it’s done right. To be free to defend your rights in the 21st century, you must first secure custody of your money  
the incoming wave of government-led central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are designed to restrict payments in a variety of different ways, such as granting social credit scores that regulate access to certain goods and services, or dictating what can be sold and even at what price. Money is the instrument of choice for imposing control over citizens, and Bitcoin is the only money that cannot be corrupted by political influence.
    
Bitcoin makes it possible to secure and transport your wealth without anyone's permission, and your wealth cannot be debased.
 
"Bitcoin’s [monetary properties](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) are designed from the ground up to be superior to all other forms of money. It is extremely portable, perfectly scarce, highly divisible, easily verifiable, durable, fungible, and extraordinarily resistant to censorship  
Bitcoin is pieces of super-gold flying inside an unstoppable PayPal. It is the best money we ever had.  
Bitcoin is the [people’s money](https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1245205778849394688?s=20): for the people, by the people. Not controlled by anyone; auditable and useable by everyone.
 
Bitcoin is for the billions, not the billionaires
 
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-bitcoin-renaissance-is-coming](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-bitcoin-renaissance-is-coming)  
The way is through a new kind of Venice in cyberspace available to anyone in the world regardless of one’s wealth, class, race, religion, gender, nationality, or occupation. Where any of the billions with internet access can connect to this revolution, be a part of it, and even own a piece of it. That’s what makes this revolution so much different from the ones that came before. Whereas those achieved change through new hierarchical structures, Bitcoin will change the world through decentralization.
   

Bitcoin has the highest value density of all assets since it is pure information, it can be magically beamed across the internet. You could have a billion dollars worth of bitcoin in your head, retaining your wealth even if stripped naked."
   

Bitcoin is long volatility and short credit  
Basically this means you use bitcoin to protect against volatility, because you think the credit (debt) bubble is gonna pop  
Long volatility is an insurance contract  
Being long something means it's increasing and you want to own it  
When people are running away from risk, they flood into _long volatility_ instruments  
Stocks/equities are a short volatility instrument  
No one wants to own risk, they want to own something that goes up in price when people are running away from risk, and it's called insurance
   

I'm betting that in at least 30-50 years (more-so on the sooner side) there is going to be a market correction that unwinds the absolutely staggering amount of leverage in our current system, and it's not gonna be pretty. We live in a world where all of the banks, governments, and corporations are in mountains of debt, the price of money is completely arbitrary, and there's no end in sight to all of this fiscal irresponsibility. Our society is structurally on a great big house of cards. It's extremely irresponsible, and someone will have to pay for it all. The great deleveraging will probably be the worst financial crisis in world history. Bitcoin is insurance against the failure of legacy financial system.
   

THEY INVENTED A BETTER MONEY  
Who does that??  
If you look at all the attributes of a good money, bitcoin is superior in every way  
It just needs more time for adoption to smooth over its volatility and then it’s unstoppable
   

Bitcoin is the Manhattan project of the financial singularity  
The world of finance will be remade with bitcoin at the core

Its not getting banned, the US knows it needs to establish itself as a leader in the space, it fits the freedom narrative, and states are already adopting really favorable policies. Also it has big money behind it. Bitcoin is a trojan horse for freedom, it's monetary properties are too enticing (and it's technology has spun off into so many side projects) that it's impossible to ban, it's a positive feedback loop since it was designed as a win win system.
 
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/41000-bitcoin-price-is-a-sign-of-success](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/41000-bitcoin-price-is-a-sign-of-success)  
Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer cash system unlike any monetary system that has ever existed throughout the history of humanity. Its competitors are far inferior in regards to settlement time, openness, ease of use, and credibility of their monetary policy. Over the first thirteen years of its existence more and more individuals have come to recognize these fundamentals and the fact that they catapult Bitcoin into a different category when compared with others attempting to bring these use cases to market. That is why so much intellectual, financial and sweat capital has poured into the network to date and why even more will continue to pour in moving forward. Humanity is restructuring itself around a Truth machine in Bitcoin. This is where one's focus should lie. Not on whether or not it is a good time to buy or sell bitcoin. That activity is for the distracted.
 
[https://21-ways.com/3/](https://21-ways.com/3/)  
Due to its lack of physicality, there is no limit to what shape your bitcoin might have: text, QR codes, images, sound, artworks, emojis - the only limiting factor is our imagination (more on that in Chapter 17). Whether we are talking about storage or the transmission of transactions, Bitcoin can shapeshift into anything it needs to be. This magical property is, in part, what makes Bitcoin so resilient to censorship. Bitcoin transactions can be encoded into pretty much anything, and - of course - they can be sent via end-to-end encrypted communication channels, making them completely unrecognizable. How can you censor something if you can’t tell what you’re looking at?
 
[https://medium.com/coinmonks/salability-of-bitcoin-845f393ec844](https://medium.com/coinmonks/salability-of-bitcoin-845f393ec844)  
According to the Austrian theory, what determines the success of a medium of exchange in becoming money is its relative salability. Salability (liquidity) determines bitcoin’s popularity as a medium of exchange because liquidity minimizes the costs of exchange  
The key function of money is to facilitate indirect exchange with the least amount of economic sacrifice. The property that minimizes the costs of exchange is salability
   

Through game theory, and financial incentives, bitcoin harnesses the greed of first world capitalists in order to spread financial freedom across the third world.

LESSON ONE: FIAT INFLATION IS INEVITABLE  
LESSON TWO: BITCOIN IS PERMAWARE, CRYPTO IS SOFTWARE  
LESSON THREE: SMART CONTRACT PLATFORMS HAVE WEAK MOATS  
(Towards the end of 2020, the crypto world assumed that Ethereum had achieved an unsurpassable ecosystem network effect, due to developer attention, DApp interoperability and "money legos." But, within just one year, this narrative was flipped on its head. Chains such as Solana, BSC and Polygon have surpassed the Ethereum network in total transaction activity and daily users.)  
LESSON FOUR: WE CAN BUILD ANYTHING ON BITCOIN  
(Over the last year, we have managed to bring Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility to Bitcoin, replicate DeFi products such as trading, lending and yield generation and to do so on a Bitcoin sidechain that leverages merged mining)

The servers [Edward Snowden](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/edward-snowden) used to leak thousands of documents to journalists were paid for using bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin)), the [National Security Agency](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/nsa) whistleblower revealed at the Bitcoin 2019 Conference on June 27.  
Snowden was working as a [CIA](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cia) subcontractor in 2013 when his leak revealed that telecom companies and governments were involved in “almost Orwellian” mass surveillance programs that swept up the phone records of unsuspecting Americans.  
Speaking via video-link from [Russia](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia), he described the ability to exchange and transact without being watched and recorded “is the foundation of all rights” — and said bitcoin was helping to deliver [privacy](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/privacy) in an age of heightened surveillance.

The Internet is a fierce challenge to the nation state as a provider of identity and therefore money, hence #Crypto.  
Cryptocurrency is here to stay. Some nation states will go to war with it, some nation states will try to co-opt it and both will miss the whole point of it.  
It’s not cryptocurrency they are fighting, it’s the internet. The nations that fight cryptocurrency will only impede their own progress into the next era of the internet and all the bounties that it shall bring. One way or the other, as the internet civilisation, we can’t turn the dial back on time and technology … it’s not a force we can stop, because we as a generation will fade away into time and the young digital beings will inevitably take over from us.

You can use treasuries, cash, gold or mortgages right now and BTC will also serve that role. The difference is this is one collateral the collateral holder knows can't be diluted away and has no counterparty risk. It's an actual asset rather than the commonly used debt products (mortgages, bonds) which are merely promises to pay, depend on subjective ratings agencies, and we know how that turned out in '08.
       
It's the first accounting innovation in 700 years  
It's the first immutable ledger in human history  
100% public and transparent
      

Bitcoin has the potential to drastically change second and third world counties. Many of those countries have no banking system, no easy way of persevering wealth, tons of corruption, and little to no infrastructure.

when it comes to money, the state has all the motivation in the world to shut down a competing system. This - and only this - is why Bitcoin’s design is so intricate and complicated. Its incentive-driven architecture favors one thing above all else: survival. Because you would have to destroy all parts of it simultaneously, a radically decentralized system is extremely resilient to any kind of disruption

Releasing his software into the wild set in motion a multi-decade process that is driven by an extremely powerful incentive structure. An unstoppable idea, embodied in code. It is this incentive structure that drives Bitcoin’s survival. And with every passing day that Bitcoin refuses to die, humanity is one step closer to freeing money from the capture of the state. It will take some time for the world to come to grips with this most powerful idea.

It is also worth noting that just like other monetary goods, bitcoin is not a company, it doesn’t pay a dividend or have cash flows. Therefore, its value must be derived from its ability to better fulfill the characteristics of a monetary good compared to traditional alternatives.

Bitcoin is a direct response to the financial crisis of 2008 and the inability of our centralized systems to take proper action. Bitcoin is an opt-out monetary good that allows the user to exit the nation-state system and take sovereignty of their own wealth. It is a voice against wrongful and misguided authority and the embodiment of protest.
 
In this report, Fidelity got a lot of things right: bitcoin being considered separate from crypto, the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) showing that Bitcoin grows stronger by the day, the network’s enforceable scarcity as a highlight, why Bitcoin can’t be supplanted, struggles Bitcoin has endured, presenting bitcoin as a starting point for digital portfolios and the risks associated.

This is the end of sovereign immunity, not only are bonds a bad deal in an inflationary environment, but the precedent has now been set that those reserves can be taken away  
This has huge geopolitical consequences and marks the end of the dollar as a safe reserve asset for many countries around the world  
China is taking notice, because they hold a trillion dollars of US debt in reserves  
Holding debt in foreign reserves, may be seized by the US or EU  
Apparently the precedent had been set with Iran in 2012 but that was on a much smaller scale  
This marks the end of the US dollar based global financial system, because dollars are no longer a neutral money

This whole thread is great, but specifically  
"The entire WORLD now runs on the internet, and WILL continue to run on the internet.  
We are currently living in The Exponential Age at this point in history. Technology is evolving the world at a rate faster than ever before in HISTORY. Simply put, the world is moving at light speed.  
==Bitcoin was created by an== **unknown person** ==who went by the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" on January 3rd, 2009.== **Satoshi's vision** ==was to create the first EVER proper form of== **Digital Money.** ==This Digital Money needed to have a fixed supply, be secure, and permissionless. With== **Bitcoin**==, there is not a single person in the== **world** ==that has the power to turn the system off, alter or block a transaction, or alter the max supply of this new currency.==  
**System never turns off**==: Digital Money that runs 24/7 for the rest of Human and AI's total existence.==  
**Be Secure**==: It is impossible to exploit the network, change the network, or devalue the network.==  
**Fixed Supply**==: It is mathematically impossible to devalue the money against itself. There is no inflation.==  
==On== **Dec. 13, 2010,** ==Satoshi officially resigned from working on Bitcoin and handed the project off to the world to complete. Bitcoin's core values had already been set, and it was up to the world to keep it safe, secure, and forever running.==  
**Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is running flawlessly, and is absolutely thriving in adoption. Nobody knows who Satoshi is today, or if he's even alive.**  
==Currently, Bitcoin usage is growing at an exponential rate, as information about it and it’s ease of access is taking the world by storm. Check out this chart displaying how the Bitcoin adoption is growing at the same speed as the adoption of the Internet.==  
==Billionaires are buying it, country’s are adopting it as an official currency, the US government is accepting it for tax payments, and the world is trying to go greener to acquire it. The list goes on. This is all happening within a short decade. The demand for Bitcoin will only continue to accelerate from here.==  
**The toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube. Bitcoin is taking the world by surprise and there is no stopping it. The world’s finally taking advantage of this fair, secure, and incorruptible money. The world is learning to store its wealth on the Bitcoin network. It is a black hole sucking up the world's corrupt, controlling, and unlimited supply of Government money. People are taking back control of what hard earned money is all about.**  
**Bitcoin is digital gold, it is financial freedom, and it is the future of economic energy.**  
==Theoretically, because Government money has an unlimited supply, the price of Dollars per Bitcoin can go to infinity when compared to it as Bitcoin has a max supply. So why do we want to get in early?==  
==The reality is, governments cannot stop printing money. It is impossible to stop printing money, and with Bitcoin having a forever fixed supply of 21 million coins, it mathematically will 100% continue to rise in value against a currency that has a maximum supply of infinity, assuming there is demand for Bitcoin. (The strongest currency)==  
==Read what I said above again. The price of Bitcoin is literally going to== _infinity_ ==against the dollar. Bitcoin is number go up technology against ALL currencies of the world.==  
Bitcoin mathematically is the strongest currency in the world. It is a perfect place to store long term wealth, and exchange economic value with another entity.

Now, what would happen if there was no bank? Who decides who was the first one to swipe? What if it wasn’t only you two, but hundreds or even thousands of people coordi­nating? What if you didn’t trust those people? What if some of those people are trying to cheat, e.g., by setting their clocks back so that it looks like they spent the money a couple of minutes earlier?
 
A time-related tool [is] needed to estab­lish a canon­ical ordering and to enforce a unique history in the absence of any central coordi­nator. -Giacomo Zucco, Discov­ering Bitcoin (2019)
 
This problem is precisely why all previous attempts of digital cash required a central­ized registry. You always had to trust someone to correctly identify the order of things. A central­ized party was required to keep the time.
 
Bitcoin solves this problem by re-inventing time itself. It says no to seconds and yes to blocks.
 
In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distrib­uted timestamp server to generate compu­ta­tional proof of the chrono­log­ical order of trans­ac­tions. -Satoshi Nakamoto (2009)

Bitcoin's proof-of-work serves as a bridge between the world of atoms and the realm of information. This bridge can be built in one way and one way only: by coming up with information that is so unique, so preposterously unlikely, that certain things had to happen in the real world for this information to appear. The rules of the game and the nature of physical law allow for no other possibility.
 
……
 
If you control the money, you control the purchasing power. Which, in turn, allows you to control most other things.  
This is neither hard to see nor hard to understand: if you can dictate who gets the money, you can dictate who is well off and who is not. If you can decide who is allowed to create new money, you can decide who has to work for money and who gets it unjustly, with the stroke of a pen or the push of a button. If you can control the flow of money, you can decide who can pay, who can get paid, who can withdraw, who has access to their bank accounts, and who has access to financial infrastructure in general. In short: you can decide who will be deplatformed from society. In the most extreme cases, this is a matter of life and death. Who gets to eat and who must starve; who gets to prosper, and who must perish.
 
(And GC will add - this is literally the control over people's time, the time you spend laboring is what is getting warped here, you could be making more for your time if it wasn't syphoned off. You could be doing a lot with that time, you could work less, vacation longer, and retire earlier. Very literally theft above and beyond direct taxation,  
Money is time and energy  
By controlling people's energy you control their movement, their actions. Where they go, what they eat, drink, where they sleep. By shutting off people's money or controlling it, you can control their internet and their cell phone. You can stop them from buying or renting a home, or a car, or a train ticket. You can literally stop them from accessing their life savings.

I can turn this into a podcast series,  
This is part 8 of why bitcoin is good as fuck - it's secure…  
Its clickbaity and I have so many good ideas
   

I would change this to say "value transfer protocol"
 ![TCP transmission control protocol SMTP simple mail...](Exported%20image%2020251228193047-1.png)     

1. What is Bitcoin?
    1. The great excel spreadsheet in the sky
    2. Bitcoin is digital gold, but it's so much more than that, saying bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone
    3. Bitcoin is the value transfer protocol, it's the money for the internet and the internet of money
    4. Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems, enabling absolute, immutable scarcity, the result of which, enables the freedom of humanity from the oppressive monetary exploitation of the state.
    5. Once you understand bitcoin in all its complexity your life and your view of the world will change forever. It's a peaceful, unstoppable revolution
2. They invented a better money, who does that??
    1. It's the first accounting innovation in 700 years, decentralized verification that is
    2. Bitcoin is the culmination of decades of research, and some genius/team who put it all together
    3. Monetary properties are superior to that of gold and fiat, was designed from the ground up to have the strongest monetary properties of any asset in history
        1. Put the fidelity picture here
    4. It's a piece of super gold, flying around the world at the speed of light through an unstoppable paypal, with no one in control.
3. Platform of trust
    1. Solved byzantine general's problem
    2. Trust machine, the rules are set in code, you don't have to trust anyone with your money
    3. No double spend, invention of digital scarcity
    4. Bitcoin isn't a company, it’s not an organization, it doesn’t have anyone in charge, it’s the ultimate neutral third party
    5. It’s best to think of bitcoin as a combination of digital gold and PayPal, where you can send gold at the speed of light,
        1. The network is as unchanging and as automatic as the laws of physics, like handing a piece of gold to someone. So bitcoin keeps track of the gold and the transfer. There is no third-party involved when you hand a rock to someone, Gold is an element from nature, and physics governs the rules to hand a rock to someone else. Bitcoin is the money and the network, it’s both matter and the laws of physics that governs it, except this is all existing in cyberspace.
            1. Usually there's no physics in cyberspace, you can copy a file as many times as you want, or to extend the metaphor, you could hand some gold to thousands of people at the same time.
            2. Bitcoin establishes a set of unchanging laws of physics in cyberspace, it's the law of the conservation of energy
    6. Bitcoin was the invention of digital property, and it’s the only crypto network that has its own laws of physics . Every other chain has a dev team or a ceo who can roll back and hardfork if they really need it. Bitcoin is the only project that works on its own, like if
4. Bitcoin is one of a kind and has no competition
    1. Eth killers vs btc killers
    2. Some even argue that bitcoin and crypto aren't the same thing, bitcoin has been number one since its inception, and since all of the ICO failures of 2017, no one tries to compete anymore, Bitcoin's network effect is too strong, and it's become more of a 'if you can't beat them join them' kind of situation
    3. Bitcoin is less like myspace or AOL, and more like the internet itself
    4. Anyone who is in crypto knows that bitcoin is one of a kind, sure there are stablecoins for less volitility, and faster transaction coins for a better medium of exchange, but these aren't trying to compete, they're different value props
    5. Other crypto's are PoS, or they're straight up scams
    6. Other crypto's aren't even trying to compete with bitcoin, bitcoin IS the money
    7. Bitcoin's competition is actual gold, and fiat currencies, and CBDC's, all of which are flawed
    8. The world would prefer neutral bitcoin to chinese cbdc yuan
    9. Once you understand that bitcoin is the best money ever created, it has no competition, and no facebook crypto is coming along to defeat myspace bitcoin, you will start to realize that bitcoin is unique
    10. “One of the biggest reasons is that any improvement in one characteristic of bitcoin, such as improving its speed or scalability, leads to a reduction in another characteristic, such as bitcoin’s level of decentralization or security. This tradeoff is known as the blockchain trilemma.” -Fidelity paper
5. Systematic economic risk
    1. Opt out of financial system
    2. Bitcoin is a direct response to the financial crisis of 2008
        1. The genesis block
    3. Bitcoin is long volatility and short credit
        1. Debt spiral/bond market
        2. It's insurance against the failure of fiat, noah's ark
6. Cantillon effect and inflation
    1. New money distributed to banks first
7. Fiat Capitalism
    1. old regime of short-term thinking, top-down planning, consumption-driven spending, growth obsession, central banking, bailouts, rent-seeking, regulatory capture, toxic bigness, risk transfer, globalism, and financialization
    2. The weaponization of FX reserves
    3.   
        
    
8. CBDC
    1. Big oof
    2. Will the world use China's surveillance coin?
9. Internet of money
    1. Saying Bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone
    2. Bitcoin is the native currency of the internet, but it's more than that, it's the internet of money
    3. The value transfer protocol (show puzzle picture)
    4. "A network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation."
    5. Democratizes value, like the internet democratizes information
    6. It’s a decentralized internet
        1. Combining its programmability with immutable bedrock foundation
        2. Layers and layers can be added to it
10. Decentralized/immutable/incorruptible
    1. Hash rate is the value prop
    2. Node distribution
    3. Nakamoto consensus
        1. Truth through physics, not humans
    4. This is the biggest differentiator between bitcoin and everything else that has ever existed
    5. Satoshi left the project December 21st 2010 and has never been heard from again
    6. The whole point of bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money
11. 21MM Supply cap
    1. A lot of things are scarce, but the only things that are perfectly scarce/finite are time and bitcoin
        1. (and that's because bitcoin is a clock and a new form of time but more on that later)
    2. Perfect scarcity, the halvening
    3. Deflationary, number go up
    4. Difficulty adjustment
    5. Stock to flow, hardest money ever created
    6. Digital gold, everyone deserves to be able to save their money, historically that’s been in gold or diamonds, bitcoin is the first digital and globally accessible version of that
    7. Not a credit based system, no systematic risks
    8. There's not enough bitcoin for every millionaire to own one
    9. Can't be debased
        1. No one can control it
        2. Perfect scarcity, the halvening
        3. Perfect elasticity, difficulty adjustment
        4. This is also noah's ark, save humanity from itself kind of thing
        5. Cantillon effect
        6. Bitcoin is a battery for monetary energy
12. Perfect inelasticity
    1. difficulty adjustment
    2. When you mine more, the supply doesn't increase
    3. Helps keep the price going up
13. Intervention free market
    1. Whales can sell/buy bitcoin to move the price up and down, but that's basically all they can do
    2. Since bitcoin is a debit based system, all credit comes from additional layers and won't fundamentally affect the main asset
    3. The supply is perfectly elastic which means no one can make more of it, even when the price goes up
    4. No one can acquire bitcoin unless they do the work mining it, or they earn it from someone else. Bitcoin is the hardest asset to confiscate so the only real way to acquire it is by providing a service.
    5. There's no banks to bail out, no lender of last resort, and no moral hazard
    6. The price crashes right away, and has gotten less and less volatile over time as weak hands sell to strong hands.
        1. Because the price crashes right away, there's no way for excess leverage to build up in the system, it gets flushed out pretty regularly, and therefore avoids systematic risks.
14. Infinitely divisible
    1. It doesn't have to be inflationary if it's a debit based system, by being infinitely divisible it can expand with the economy
    2. It can store all of the wealth in the solar system
    3. In a debit based system, you don't need inflation to expand the money supply as the economy grows, you need an infinitely divisible money to subdivide and absorb the growing economy
    4. Anyone on earth can afford a little piece of bitcoin
    5. You can do microtransactions
15. Transparency
    1. Open source
    2. Every transaction ever is free to see by anyone

18. Unconfiscateable
    1. As long as you protect your password, it can't be stolen
    2. Your password is an unfathomly huge number that can't be guessed
19. Neutral/non biased
    1. Bitcoin is just a set of rules, completely voluntary to join the network
    2. Independent 3rd party
    3. Global, 3rd party, monetary & financial system
    4. The rules don't discriminate, and don't favor anyone over another

    2. Censorship resistance needs to come from the edges, there are ways of enhancing privacy and we have to make them the default
    3. Protects against a future of CBDC's
    4. All other rights are at stake if they can track and control your money
23. Permissionless
    1. Because bitcoin is pure information, because the network is open and neutral, and because there is no reliance on third parties, bitcoin can be sent without permission
    2. It's all just math, anyone on earth can generate a private key because it's just a number
    3. Anyone on earth can send a bitcoin transaction without it being intercepted, censored, or stopped
    4. There are many private ways to send a bitcoin transaction too, since it's all just information, you can send the transaction within an image, or a song, you can broadcast it via radio, call a phone service to decrypt, send it over satellite, or the easiest way via an app on your phone.
24. Network effect
    1. It’s best defense is it’s network
    2. It was a spontaneous birth
    3. It grew under the radar
    4. Now it’s extremely powerful
    5. And it’s unmatched
    6. There's the developers, there's the institutions, there's the investors, and there's the merchants, all who would have to move to a different project, none of which are decentralized
25. It's history, struggles it has endured in it's past,
    1. the block size war, changing of interpretations
    2. Even all of the failed digital monies before it
    3. All the bans
    4. All of the crashes

28. Reliable/can’t be turned off
    1. Its incentive-driven architecture favors one thing above all else: survival
    2. Bitcoin's heartbeat pumps every 10 minutes
    3. If the internet was split up, or it collapsed, or it was shut off, 99.99% of all nodes could be destroyed, as long as a bitcoin node survives it can reshuffle the ledger and start back up automatically
29. Bitcoin is pure information
    1. Beamed across the internet
