2. Systematic economic risk
    
    1. Our financial system is fragile
        1. We're in the largest economic experiment in the history of mankind
        2. The global economy is extremely complex, and risk happens fast
        3. Governments have taken actions to prevent markets from properly clearing, government moral hazard from bailouts, this leads to a growth of underbrush (the forest fire analogy) n
    2. Opt out of financial system
    3. Bitcoin is a direct response to the financial crisis of 2008
        1. The genesis block
    4. Bitcoin is long volatility and short credit
        1. Debt spiral/bond market
        2. It's insurance against the failure of fiat, noah's ark
            1. it’s a Noah’s ark lifeboat for the global economic experiment we call Fiat currencies,
            2.   
                
    
    - Bitcoin was born out of the great financial crisis
        - An economic collapse caused by big banks and financial institutions
        - Bitcoin was designed as a way to replace banks
        - Everyone can be their own bank
        - A world free from unnecessary financial middlemen
    
    - “Bitcoin has always been exactly this: a tool for the end game, An escape hatch for the inevitable dysfunction and failure of central bank monetary policy.”
    
    At the end of the day, you either believe central banks will be forced to continuously expand the money supply or that they won’t.  
    If that is the inevitable fate of this debt-driven, overly-financialized world we inhabit, then all Bitcoin needs to do is respond to that monetary expansion better than any other asset.  
    And that my dear friends, is what Bitcoin does better than any other asset known to man.

        - WHAT IS A DEBT SPIRAL???
        - [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1562078782453792768.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1562078782453792768.html)
        - This version is long form
          
           

- Look up the domino episode that guy swann did
    - Everyone's asset is someone else's liability
    - Explain deritives and how they're collateral
- Explain how a debt collapse happens
    - What actually happens when a debt bubble pops
    - (no one really understands this)
    - How a liquidity crisis works
        - Could start anywhere in the world
        - In 1997 in Thailand, there were huge capital inflows at a fixed exchange rate, and the country devalued the assets, so investors sold, the contagion spread to Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Russia, and then Long term capital management - James rickards
            - It can take a long time to play out, in 2007 two barren sturns hedge funds went illiquid, suspended redemptions and then fannymae and feddy mac
    - It's a series of dominos,
        - **Everybody wants their money back**
        - So all asset classes behave the same way, **they all go down**, all the spreads widen until either there's a sequential financial failure or you shut every market in the world
        - In 1998 Greenspan lowered rates and everything calmed down, Long term capital management was bailed out
        - In 2008 Goldman sachs was bailed out overnight
        - A recession and a financial collapse are two different things
    - 2008 was about bad debt, people borrowed money and they couldn't pay it back
        - The collateral for the loans was no good because it was real estate and prices went down
    - It all starts with defaults
        - Someone borrowed too much, they can't pay it back
        - Why can't they pay it back? They lose their job or interest rates are too high, or they took on more than they could chew, or the loans were given to people who could never pay it back
          
        
      
      
     - Bitcoin is long volatility and short credit
    - Basically this means you use bitcoin to protect against volatility, because you think the credit (debt) bubble is gonna pop
    - Long volatility is an insurance contract
    - Being long something means it's increasing and you want to own it
    - When people are running away from risk, they flood into _long volatility_ instruments
    - Stocks/equities are a short volatility instrument
    - No one wants to own risk, they want to own something that goes up in price when people are running away from risk, and it's called insurance   
- I'm betting that in at least 20-30 years (more-so on the sooner side 10-15) there is going to be a market correction that unwinds the absolutely staggering amount of leverage in our current system, and it's not gonna be pretty. We live in a world where all of the banks, governments, and corporations are in mountains of debt, the price of money is completely arbitrary, and there's no end in sight to all of this fiscal irresponsibility. Our society is structurally on a great big house of cards. It's extremely irresponsible, and someone will have to pay for it all. The great deleveraging (or the opposite outcome, the great hyperinflation) will probably be the worst financial crisis in world history. Bitcoin is insurance against the failure of legacy financial system. - I just have to get more heated about the death spiral and unsustainability of our large debts as my marketing for bitcoin
- Bitcoin is an insurance policy against the great deleveraging, if it ever occurs
 
- Reference the housing bubble of 08, our entire global financial infrastructure is leveraged to a degree never before seen in history. The ruling class can't ever let this system collapse, and the only way to prop it up if there are ever stressors is by flooding the failing sectors with liquidity. The only way out is inflation.
    
Bitcoin is security for an unknown future

12. Society is literally crumbling, ukraine and russia have the largest crypto ownership per capita it's easy to see how bitcoin's ultimate security, and tank like payments could play a large roll in any social unrest

But what happens if the USD stumbles? What if the Fed errs so badly that inflation spirals out of control, and then confidence in the USD drains from the rest of the world?
 
The Almighty Dollar Collapses.

When money is created the govt owes interest on the dollar. More debt is needed to pay back the previous loan. Creating a cycle of never ending debt.
    
[Podcast 7: Interview with Matthew Pines (btcpolicy.org) Can Bitcoin Fix US National Security Threats?](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2K2SP7dvu79MZSt6PiQFFG?si=m_00u4qtQtuoAHbJgMHyhA)

- China is coming off of bonds
- The western world relies on out international systems to function properly

- In march of 2020 the us treasury market seized up,
- It's not supposed to do that, this is the deepest most liquid market in the world,
- Every other market in the world depends on the US treasury market to be stable
- When you're in a system like ours that has lots of debt, and continually requires you to push more and more debt out, that's not a sustainable system,
- You would want to be searching for alternative arrangements to migrate the dollar system to from a treasury based reserve asset standard, to maybe a bitcoin based reserve asset standard
    - In a 10-20 year time horizon, if the treasury is already this unstable, and we're committed to a trillion dollar at a minimum indefinitely, at a certain point you have to monitize those debts, you have to enforce financial repression, that leads to capital controls, and a certain breakdown of domestic rule of law, and would undermine the global reserve currency status of the dollar because we have to remain an open capital account and allow foreign flows to come in, and if we're running capital controls it would potentially break the premise of that system, so we're headed into a period where there's a lot of risk attached to this market, onto which US national security depends, we should be exploring alternatives, not just hope that this thing is going to be stable and is going to work for all time.
    - Then you add in the geopolitical element and you see our adversaries are actively challenging that system and are actively trying to promote an alternative system that advantages them, in that alternative system which is principally based off of gold, China russia turkey india, the great asian powers have been strategically acquiring gold for the past 10-15 years, and while we do have a lot of structural advantages, that's not a promising trendline, at what point does this pose a potential vulnerability to the west,
    - The basic idea is IF you had this scenario where there was a crisis of confidence in the treasury market, and it had to be essentially euthanized, and therefore it stopped being a useful form of global collateral and the Eurodollar system became severely curtailed as a useful store of value/medium of exchange for that system, and the system started looking for an alternative store of value, and whether our adversaries are pushing gold or some sort of commodity backed bank core idea, who knows, then they would gain relative to us,
    - so if bitcoin were to play the neutral reserve role instead of gold, then the US being the predominate holder of bitcoin, and having much more endogenous open, capital markets and political system, that's sort of in alignment with bitcoin which is all about open, freedom to transact, peer to peer, liberal kind of orientation, as opposed to authoritarian idea that we control the gold, and put everyone in a digital panopticon to control everyone, that is a more promising alternative, it behooves the united states to examine that
    -   
        
      
    
    I would also put technological deflation in here because it’s along the same lines credit expansion, just adds another layer to it  
    Once you realize we’re trapped in a cycle of credit expansion and you think through the consequences of that, you then layer on top of that the acceleration credit inflation that will be needed as the next industrial revolution kicks off and drops costs extremely low extremity fast  
    You need a deflationary economic system in a deflationary world
    
      
      
      
    

[Why Another Volcker Can't Save Us This Time](https://youtu.be/b8ElD1KktWw)  
One of the better videos I’ve ever seen on the topic, all about why small increases in interest rates will result in huge servicing costs for the government  
Why were in a pickle at over 120% debt to GDP  
How debt to GDP was only 30% in the 80s  
Why the Fed will pivot and have to buy on the treasuries, inflation will run rampant and no one will want to hold low yielding 30 year treasuries and the Fed will have to buy them all

Good explanation on debt spiral
   

In a time of mistrust, we need trustless money to carry us through. Perhaps, on the other side of this disruptive period, this trustless money can form the ground upon which human civilization can anchor relations of mutual benefit and cooperation, of gains through balanced trade that can help drive the technological innovation and economic growth upon which our collective future depends.

[After Fiat Fails, What Happens Next?](https://youtu.be/FWycTVZQWmQ)

50. There are only four types of money, public ledger, private ledger, commodity Money, and commodity backed money
51. The heresy financial guy goes into what a CBDC is and the new commodity backed money that the brick countries are creating
52. Basically fiat is doomed to fail it is not a long-term sustainable solution and the future of money will either be commodity backed or bitcoin which is like a digital commodity money or a public ledger
53. Also commodity backed money puts us in the same trust based system that we’ve always been in, you would have to know if the commodities are actually there or if the money is being re-hypothecated, also settling the currency into the commodities that back it is extremely difficult and you would have to ship the commodities all over the world, there’s really no competition for bitcoin
