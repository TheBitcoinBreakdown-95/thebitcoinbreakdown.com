- **CBDC's are surveillance disguised as money**

Bitcoin's censorship resistance is its value proposition  
They are the natural next step in a world with states trying to reclaim power  
Without bitcoin, without a truly invincible decentralized alternative,  
That's why it's so important, that's why bitcoin is critically important for a free future

    - Without direct control of your money, years of working and saving can be taken from you in an instant. Bitcoin is a more transparent, predictable way to protect your wealth or raise money for a cause, as long as it’s done right. To be free to defend your rights in the 21st century, you must first secure custody of your money
    - the incoming wave of government-led central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are designed to restrict payments in a variety of different ways, such as granting social credit scores that regulate access to certain goods and services, or dictating what can be sold and even at what price. Money is the instrument of choice for imposing control over citizens, and Bitcoin is the only money that cannot be corrupted by political influence.

If the state becomes corrupt, needs to prop up their failing currency, or begins sanctioning peaceful protestors with emergency measures — as happened in Canada last week — **your money could be seized without so much as a warrant.**
 
CBDCs aim to replace paper money with electronic credits that can be easily surveilled, confiscated, auto-taxed, and debased via negative interest rates. They pave the way for social engineering, pinpoint censorship and deplatforming, and expiration dates on money.

CBDCs allow for the unfettered ability to spy on the users. They also invite the use of corrupt incentives to force users to behave however those in power desire. CBDCs go beyond the pervasive power to "control the money printer." CBDCs allow governments to control when and where you can spend. The obvious problem with this type of technology is that CBDCs can exclude individuals or businesses that are not "in line" with the current political leanings of the party in power. CBDCs can and will be used to control everything from which grocery stores you shop at to which political candidates you can support. CBDCs will be used to control which businesses can accept payment, and they'll be used to cut off support to store owners who don't follow government mandates. The ability to shut someone out of the financial system in a cashless society (which is where we are headed) would be a death sentence. No central authority anywhere should have this power. Unfortunately, we as human beings won't be able to resist the temptation to use the power inherent in the design of CBDCs against our enemies.  
Governments can and will use CBDCs to economically incentivize us to do whatever the state wants us to do or face being cut off from the digital economy in which we all live. I don't have to explain why Bitcoin is so important to counter this looming threat to our freedoms and liberties, but we should also be pushing back against Biden's attraction to CBDCs regardless of the power of Bitcoin.

- [Digital Currency Can Be a Tool for Surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/new-digital-dollar-could-shake-us-financial-system/)
    - Digital currency issued by a central bank can be used as a tool for government surveillance of citizens and control over their financial transactions. This has been a concern with China's digital currency, which is in the early stages of rollout. As Akram Keram, an expert on China at the National Endowment for Democracy, wrote last year, “With digital yuan, the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] will have direct control over and access to the financial lives of individuals, without the need to strong-arm intermediary financial entities. In a digital-yuan-consumed society, the government easily could suspend the digital wallets of dissidents and human rights activists, for example.”

In China, millions of individuals and businesses, blacklisted as “unworthy” based on social media credit scores that grade them based on whether they are “good” citizens, have been banned from accessing financial markets, buying real estate or travelling by air or train.

David W. CBDC article
   

Satoshi realized that the urge to control people's money is irresistible and corrupts absolutely.
 
Thus, he created Bitcoin, which cares not for human desire and ticks only according to laws of mathematics.

If you control the money, you control the purchasing power. Which, in turn, allows you to control most other things.  
This is neither hard to see nor hard to understand: if you can dictate who gets the money, you can dictate who is well off and who is not. If you can decide who is allowed to create new money, you can decide who has to work for money and who gets it unjustly, with the stroke of a pen or the push of a button. If you can control the flow of money, you can decide who can pay, who can get paid, who can withdraw, who has access to their bank accounts, and who has access to financial infrastructure in general. In short: you can decide who will be deplatformed from society. In the most extreme cases, this is a matter of life and death. Who gets to eat and who must starve; who gets to prosper, and who must perish.
 
(And GC will add - this is literally the control over people's time, the time you spend laboring is what is getting warped here, you could be making more for your time if it wasn't syphoned off. You could be doing a lot with that time, you could work less, vacation longer, and retire earlier. Very literally theft above and beyond direct taxation,  
Money is time and energy  
By controlling people's energy you control their movement, their actions. Where they go, what they eat, drink, where they sleep. By shutting off people's money or controlling it, you can control their internet and their cell phone. You can stop them from buying or renting a home, or a car, or a train ticket. You can literally stop them from accessing their life savings.

CBDC’s will never work, they take too much from banks and they are a structural risk to bank deposits, also no one wants them and central planning always fails

Buried in Joe Biden's spending bill of $3.5 trillion is a provision requiring financial institutions to report to the IRS account transactions (deposits or withdrawals) on accounts totaling more than $600.  Not only will the IRS be tasked with monitoring your bank account, but every time you swipe your debit card or write a check for more than $600, the IRS will be notified.  Last week, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen not only confirmed the proposal during a Financial Services Committee hearing but adamantly supports the snooping.  In truth, the proposal is an enormous government data-grab, the measure will add significant regulatory burdens for banks and credit unions, and it's a blatant attempt to control how you spend your money.
 
Compare this to advertising, we can give up so much data about ourselves to companies because at the end of the day what’s the worst thing they’re gonna do try to persuade us to buy something. But what if instead of only being able to persuade us of what to buy, they could control what we buy.
 
I don’t think I fully grasped the scope and impact of censoring transactions until now
 
Not only will the state siphon off “time” from its subjects (in the form of inflation + taxation) but it will also seek to control “time” in the form of censoring how that wealth can be used
    
Yes we covered that there might be a future of mass surveillance, financial repression and censorship, collapse of the debt bubble or hyperinflation, but bitcoin ownership (being independent of the state) can protect against many unforseen economic conditions as well

Here’s the problem. Removing censorship resistance defeats the entire purpose and value proposition of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is supposed to be about [banking the unbanked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Y_F3PS4JE), about granting [open access to financial tools](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-financial-freedom-in-afghanistan), about empowering otherwise [unempowered people](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/16/why-bitcoin-is-a-tool-for-social-justice/). There’s nothing valuable in remaking the same financial system – which caused these problems in the first place – with a new, fancy crypto wrapper that openly welcomes censorship just because it is new and fancy.

Here's a 5 minutes demos as to what central planners will be able to control when CBDC will be in place (ex: expiration time,maximum usage count,limitations of what you can buy) The video is further in the page, section "See CBDC Accelerator in action":
    
CBDC's, social credit scores, panopticon digital prison is coming  
This is not science fiction, they are actively working on and testing these technologies
 
CBDC’s are extrmely draconian and are one of the largest threats facing us
   

Bitcoin is our only hope  
Not government fiat  
Not gold  
Not crypto or defi
 
Only bitcoin
