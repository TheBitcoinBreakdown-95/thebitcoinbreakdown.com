- Escape the arbitrary inflation risk of centrally managed currencies!

Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins  
- Satoshi
 
- Bitcoin solves the problem of debasement, which is a wealth confiscation dilemma as old as civilization itself, literally thousands of years old, as long as there has been people 'making' money, there have been people 'making' money for themselves
- **Bitcoin solves the agency problem in base layer money and financial systems**
    1. **Because money is universally desirable, there's moral hazard and conflicts of interest within institutions that hold and manage it,**
    2. **buy separating money from human decision making, you've effectively solved a problem as old as civilization itself**
- Inflation leads to social unrest, which leads to populism which leads to unsafe nuclear conditions worldwide. Geopolitical game theory says nukes among rational entities are a stalemate, however a multipolar and populist world represents a disturbance in power structures, and possibly an extension level threat
- The true trickle down economics is the Cantillon effect
    - Coined by the economist___ and defined as____
    - New money distributed to banks first
    - How does the fed print more dollars? It doesn't just go around and say hey we're printing more dollars here you go
    - The fed gives that money to banks, those banks invest that money or lend it to other financial institutions, who invest it, it's literally trickle down economics,
    - The Fed prints more dollars and it trickles down through the economy starting with the financial community, and then into the stock market, venture capital, bond market, real estate, etc.
    - By the time it gets into the hands of the average person, that money has exchanged hands several times,
    - The ones who get the money first benefit from the new dollars, the people who get it last do not
    - This is massive wealth inequality created by the fed, housing prices have gone way up, home ownership is down and assets have concentrated into the hands of the well connected and wealthy
- Call them Cantillionairs lmao
 
- It's the solution to a global problem: How to store wealth long-term without the risk of debasement and seizure.
- Inflation
    1. Most hurts the poor
    2. Inflation is theft
    3. And more sinisterly money printing is the lifeblood of the leviathan
        1. Concentrated benefits, dispersed costs
 
Theres a whole lesson to understand why an absolutely scarce, _money_ is so important for human rights  
The global elites steal our TIME by stealing our money through inflation  
The hours we worked, we create value, and that economic energy is cyphoned off  
The 'concentrated benefits dispersed costs' of inflation make everyone pretty much blind to it  
Printed money leeks slowly through the economy and causes the prices of everything else to go up, but only long after it has been loaned into existence to prop up the global financial system
 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidade_real_de_valor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidade_real_de_valor)  
The Daily Unidade Real de Valor, or URV (Portuguese, Real Value Unit), was a non-monetary reference currency (i.e., non-fiat) created in March 1994, as part of the Plano Real in Brazil. Its main purpose was to establish a parallel currency to the cruzeiro real, free from the effects of inertial inflation on the latter, which exceeded 1,200% per year prior to the implementation of the new currency, the real.
    
The dollar is not just a piece of paper. It symbolizes a system. And that system benefits the wealthy by design. The Federal Reserve—the Bank of Banks that controls the money supply—actually has the power to tax, in a way. But that taxation power is wholly undemocratic, unaccountable, and falls disproportionately upon the poor.

- The cost of living should be massively declining
    - Think about the advent of free trade since 1971, all the tech advances that have made production and communication more efficient,
    - Think about the price of a computer and computing power and how that's improved over time
    - That phenomina, that we're seeing with technology, with your smartphone and your laptop, is also happening with tshirts and hambergers, it's just that it's not visable to us because the dollar has depreciated in value,
    - Inflation is not mearly the CPI, it's a whole variety of things that aren't reflected,
    - CPI is a government basket, and is extremely misleading, but isn't technically wrong
- ==The world technically== **revolves** ==around Money. Money and economic incentives drive the world to be forever evolving space, as well as allow us to earn resources needed to live. Currently, the entire world is being plagued by money that is being devalued, assets that are being inflated, and people who are losing faith in the current system. People are getting desperate, they’re looking for an alternative, it’s getting bad.== - By developing a decentralized monetary system that made trusted third parties (the banking system) obsolete, Nakamoto also chipped away at the source of their power: the money printer. It’s the money printer that made it possible for a small clique of central bankers to centralize and seize control of the global monetary system. Though waning, they continue to wield this power to this day.

The ability to easily transmit bitcoins across borders and absence of a need for a banking system make Bitcoin an ideal monetary good to acquire for those afflicted by hyperinflation. In the coming years, as fiat monies continue to follow their historical trend toward eventual worthlessness, Bitcoin will become an increasingly popular choice for global savings to flee to.

==As Nic Carter and Ross Stevens state in their report== _Bitcoin Net Zero_==, “Hyperinflation events generally result from the mismanagement of financial systems and the economy by central governments. Bitcoin offers the world an alternative – a sound monetary system outside the control of governments and central banks.”==   
==For millions, maybe even billions of people living in developing countries with high inflation, weak property rights, and poor governance, Bitcoin is a means for them to protect their savings and grow their wealth. As Carter and Stevens put it, “People in these countries value Bitcoin’s institutional qualities, which compare favorably with their local settings.”==

**The American Financial Situation Deteriorates**  
==With the victory at Saratoga the military side of the war had improved considerably for the Americans. However, the financial situation was seriously deteriorating. The states to this point had made no voluntary payments to Congress. At the same time the continental currency had to compete with a variety of other currencies for resources. The states were issuing their own individual currencies to help finance expenditures.==  
**Moreover the British in an effort to destroy the funding system of the Continental Congress had undertaken a covert program of counterfeiting the Continental dollar. These dollars were printed and then distributed throughout the former colonies by the British army and agents loyal to the Crown (Newman, 1957).**  
==Altogether this expansion of the nominal money supply in the colonies led to a rapid depreciation of the Continental dollar (Calomiris, 1988, Michener, 1988). Furthermore, inflation may have been enhanced by any negative impact upon output resulting from the disruption of markets along with the destruction of property and loss of able-bodied men (Buel, 1998). By the end of 1777 inflation had reduced the specie value of the Continental to about twenty percent of what it had been when originally issued. This rapid decline in value was becoming a serious problem for Congress in that up to this point almost== **ninety percent of its revenue had been generated from currency emissions**==.==

**Worsening Inflation and Financial Problems**  
==As the American military situation deteriorated in the South so did the financial circumstances of the Continental Congress. Inflation continued as Congress and the states dramatically increased the rate of issuance of their currencies. At the same time the British continued to pursue their policy of counterfeiting the Continental dollar. In order to deal with inflation some states organized conventions for the purpose of establishing wage and price controls (Rockoff, 1984). With few contributions coming from the states and a currency rapidly losing its value, Congress resorted to authorizing the army to confiscate whatever it needed to continue the war effort (Baack, 2001, 2008).==  
**Yorktown**  
==Fortunately for the Americans the British military effort collapsed before the funding system of Congress.==

If it wasn’t clear before it should be abundantly clear now. We need take the ability of unfettered money printing and debt expansion out of the hands of politicians and the central banks that enable them. This is bitcoin’s strongest value prop. If you’ve been skeptical of bitcoin up to this point, yet are enraged by the fraud being laid bare in Minnesota and other parts of the United States, I implore you to drop your priors and study this particular aspect of bitcoin.
