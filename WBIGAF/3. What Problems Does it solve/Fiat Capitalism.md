    22. THE COST OF CAPITAL IS BROKEN
        - What is the cost of capital?
        - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp)
            - Cost of capital is a company's calculation of the minimum return that would be necessary in order to justify undertaking a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory.
            - Cost of capital represents the return a company needs to achieve in order to justify the cost of a capital project, such as purchasing new equipment or constructing a new building.
            - Cost of capital encompasses the cost of both equity and debt, weighted according to the company's preferred or existing capital structure. This is known as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
            - A company's investment decisions for new projects should always generate a return that exceeds the firm's cost of the capital used to finance the project. Otherwise, the project will not generate a return for investors.
        - Artificially low interest rates skew the price of money
            - Therefore the prices of everything else are skewed
        - The valuation of equities and the stock market are derived by future earnings which depend on the interest rate. When interest rates are held low, the denominator in the P/E ratio is lower, manifesting in synthetically higher stock prices
        - If we can fix the money, we can actually create a free and open market, and a free and open cost of capital, and we can actually get efficient productivity happening in the world, where we get real prices and not manipulated prices, that's why bitcoiners are in this space
    23. Bitcoin fixes the cost of capital, it returns society to one that saves instead of recklessly spends and layers on enormous amounts of risk to chase returns.
        - A capitalist society needs a base layer of savings, not be built on a house of cards
2. By participating in the dollar system, you're literally complicit in genocide 4. Everyone shits on capitalism when really what they mean is fiat capitalism
    - Capitalism by decree
    - "Capitalism" in air quotes since there's a central bank price setting the most important commodity in the entire economy
    - Capitalism but with a regulatory body with supernatural abilities to mess with everything, unlimited funding causing unchecked growth of the leviathan
    
- The dollar is broken, and I think a lot of people generally understand something is wrong, but don't realize that yet
    - It's important we have an alternative set up, that isn't captured, when that reality starts to set in for people
    - Bitcoin can be thought of
    - Our dollar is the number one shitty currency
    - If you talk to people in Argentina they want dollars
        - Their currencies are breaking first and then the dollar

    - "Charles, yes, this is why I'm so passionate about bitcoin, you know, we're addicted to the money printer in this country, and I think a nation that lives by the money printer, runs the risk of dying by it as well. I mean we used to be the world's biggest creditor nation. We made stuff. Now we're the world's biggest debtor nation, we hardly make anything except debt. So everything is distorted charles, I mean, up is down and inflation is good, our economy is like an airplane flying without an altimeter, because we have no price signals based on real interest rates, and we haven't for a long time. Instead, we have a system where insiders print money and they benefit. They create disproportionate access to capital with low interest rates, and that capital goes where? In the stocks of companies that have no real growth, they just use easy government money to finance debt and buyback shares, and create synthetic growth and these market bubbles. They buy up real estate and turn the country into renters, I mean inflation sucks the life out of workers and savers and it benefits the asset holders so all of a sudden we have this blooming wealth inequality, and politicians that contributed to the problem, who have no clue about basic economics, saying "hey I'll come fix it" by spending and handing out more easy money, I mean it's like the government cripples you and hands you a crutch and says "aren't you happy I was here to hand you this crutch?" That's why bitcoin is so great - you can't print more of it, it's programmatically scarce hard money, and as my friend preston pysh said very well today "bitcoin literally feasts on corruption and manipulation" and boy is the plate full charles"

        [https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/](https://dergigi.com/2020/04/27/dear-family-dear-friends/)  
        We, as a society, need Bitcoin more than it needs us. Money is an essential tool for any large-scale cooperation. It is a measuring device, a solution to the problem of barter, a vehicle to store your wealth over space and time, and many other things. In short: money is essential for a complex society to function. However, a series of financial crises and recent events around a certain virus outbreak have clearly shown that our money is fundamentally broken.
        
          
        
        The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.
        
          
        
        Satoshi Nakamoto
        
          
        
        The virus not only reminded us of the fragility of human life, but it also revealed the fragility of our supply chains and other global systems. In particular, it highlighted the ridiculousness of our financial and monetary system. In a matter of days, we went from printing billions to trillions, to proposals of minting trillion-dollar-denominated platinum coins, to unlimited QE and infinite cash. Economists and politicians speak of saving the economy, of injecting liquidity, of quantitative easing, of reverse repurchase agreements, of bailing out those who are too big to fail (again) — of doing everything in their power to prolong the inevitable collapse, to kick the proverbial can even further down the road.
        
          
        
        While the lingo is fancy, the repercussions are simple: an essential tool of our civilization is bent and distorted. Hyperinflation is what happens when this tool finally breaks under constant pressure. Hyperinflation or not, the repercussions for the individual are always the same: the money you save gets devalued, its purchasing power diminished. Whether your money is sitting under your mattress or in your bank account doesn’t even matter.
        
          
        
        The world has gone mad and the system is broken.
        
          
        
        Ray Dalio
        
          
        
        As Ray Dalio explains so eloquently: our debt-based system of money is inherently broken. Bitcoin fixes this. It fixes this because it is not based on debt. It fixes this because it has a strictly limited supply. It fixes this because it can’t be created arbitrarily; because there are no gatekeepers, no central powers that might corrupt it.
        
          
        
        Bitcoin is the antidote to modern monetary theory. It is necessary to straighten out the crooked world of fiat money.
        
          
          
        
    
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
    
    ==Decades ago, Warren Mosler and others resurfaced this idea, into what is now popularly known as Modern Monetary Theory or MMT.==  
    ==I have often felt that Mosler describes the case for that school of thought well. He doesn’t sugar-coat things, and instead speaks very directly:==  
    ==Start with the government trying to provision itself and how does it do it. There are different ways to do it throughout history. One way is just to go out and take slaves. Another way the British did is they provisioned their navy by going to bars late at night and dragging them onto ships. It’s called== ==impressing sailors====.==  
    ==We pretend to be more civilized as I like to say, and we use a monetary system. So how does a government do it? Clean sheet of paper, what you do, is you establish a tax that is payable in something that people don’t have. So what you want to do is transfer resources from the private sector to the public sector. You want people who are out there doing whatever they are doing, to suddenly be working for the government. You need soldiers, you need police, you need health workers, you need people in education. How do you get these people out of the private sector and into the public sector?==  
    ==First thing you do is you levy a tax. You need a tax liability, and it has to be coercive. And for this example I’ll use a property tax. You put a tax on everybody’s house, and you make it payable in your new unit of account, your new unit, your thing, your tax credit, the thing that is used to pay the tax. The dollar, the yen, or the euro- they are all tax credits.==  
    ==What has happened is, you’ve created sellers of real goods and services who now need your tax credit, or they’re going to lose their house. You’ve created unemployment- people looking for paid work. Unemployment is not about people looking to volunteer at the American Cancer Society; it’s about people looking for work because they need or want the money. And the problem with government when you want to provision yourself is that there’s no unemployment. No unemployment in terms of your currency; there may be people willing to work for other things but not for your currency. You need unemployment in terms of your currency, looking to earn your unit of account.==  
    ==So you levy a tax, now people need your unit of account, all of these people show up looking for work, all of those people are unemployed. You now hire the unemployed that your tax created, and they are now provisioning your government.==  
    ==-Warren Mosler,== ==2017 MMT Conference==  
    ==I also liked this description, where he explained his view in an economic debate:==  
    ==The way we do it, is we slap on a tax for something that nobody has, and in order to get the funds to pay that tax, you have to come to the government for it, and so that way the government can spend its otherwise worthless currency and provision itself.==  
    ==Now the way I like to explain that, is I’ll take out my business card here. Now I’ll ask this room does anybody want to buy- and this is called “how to turn litter into money”- does anybody want to buy one of these cards for a hundred dollars? No? Okay. Does anybody want to stay after hours and help vacuum the floor and clean the room and I’ll give you my cards? No? Alright. Oh by the way there’s only one door out of here and my guy is out there with a 9mm (handgun) and you can’t get out of here without one of these cards.==  
    ==Can you feel the pressure now? You’re now unemployed! In terms of my cards, you were not unemployed before. You were not looking for a job that paid in my cards. Now you’re looking for a job that pays in my cards, or you’re looking to buy them from someone else that will take a job that pays in my cards.==  
    ==[…]==  
    ==The difference between money and litter is whether there’s a tax man [outside that door]. The guy with the 9mm is the tax man. If he can’t enforce tax collection, the value of the dollar goes to zero.==  
    ==-Warren Mosler,== ==2013 MMT vs Austrian Debate==

    Within the existing fiat currency system there is a very small group with the sole ability to legally create all the fiat currency they choose, then use it to further enrich and empower themselves and their cronies. They do this at the expense of the rest of us, that is, the small group of central bankers is allowed to steal from the rest of us.  
    Central banking is an organized crime syndicate - a cartel.  
    "Money printing" is a form of theft, and it is illegal for you or I to create fiat currency from thin air. It should also be illegal for the bankers to create money from thin air. But it isn't. You see, they "print" enough money to buy/own/operate the politicians (both parties). We cannot count on the lawmakers to do the right thing when it comes to a country's supply of currency.  
    Along came Bitcoin. Separation of money and state. Freedom from the criminal banking cartel. No banker can "print" any amount of Bitcoin from thin air they way they create fiat currency. Nobody can confiscate Bitcoin as long as the seed phrase is properly secured.  
    Bitcoin says, "Fuck you" to the banking criminals and their creepy, fraudulent system of theft.

    Mises’s long-run policy prescriptions to reduce the likelihood and severity of business cycles are to limit government and central bank discretion over the money supply by linking the quantity of money and credit in the banking system to a gold standard, or to fully eliminate central bank influences over money and interest rates through an institutional shift to a private, competitive free banking system.

    Damn what an article, there’s also this Alex Gladstein tweet  
    “The weaponization of FX reserves and the sinking realization from big powers that they don’t actually control most of their savings will be seen as a turning point in history”

    This is the end of sovereign immunity, not only are bonds a bad deal in an inflationary environment, but the precedent has now been set that those reserves can be taken away  
    This has huge geopolitical consequences and marks the end of the dollar as a safe reserve asset for many countries around the world  
    China is taking notice, because they hold a trillion dollars of US debt in reserves  
    Holding debt in foreign reserves, may be seized by the US or EU  
    Apparently the precedent had been set with Iran in 2012 but that was on a much smaller scale  
    This marks the end of the US dollar based global financial system, because dollars are no longer a neutral money  
    Gold and bitcoin are the only two safe haven assets  
    (Also on a side note, if they can do this for an entire country, imagine what they can do to an individual or group of people)

    Bitcoin is a direct response to the financial crisis of 2008 and the inability of our centralized systems to take proper action. Bitcoin is an opt-out monetary good that allows the user to exit the nation-state system and take sovereignty of their own wealth. It is a voice against wrongful and misguided authority and the embodiment of protest.
    
      
      
      
      
    
      
      
      
    
    So, let's not rewrite history.  
    Libertarians tried working within the system.  
    But they saw, sooner than others, that it failed.  
    So when you see it fail...  
    Don't blame the lifeboat.  
    Blame the captain, blame the Fed, blame the state.  
    And then thank Satoshi.  
    For giving us Bitcoin.  
    The electronic exit from filthy fiat.  
    A decentralized currency, if we can keep it.
    
      
    
    Adoption of a decentralized currency...  
    to opt out of their failed state.  
    To vote against a monetary policy...  
    that they could vote against no other way.
    
      
    
    Now you didn't have to fight the Fed.  
    You could just opt out.  
    And every money printer minted a Bitcoiner.  
    Thank ye, Bernanke!  
    Quantitative easing eased adoption.
    
      
    
    Then came Satoshi, and Bitcoin.  
    Which turned all that theory into practice.  
    It solved the incentive problem...  
    better than a central bank' money.  
    And it solved the security problem...  
    better than a giant state's guns.
    
      
    
    Because the practicalities weren't there.  
    Why would central banks give up their money?  
    Why would giant states give up their power?  
    Ironically, libertarians got beat by money and guns!  
    No incentives better than a central bank's money.  
    No security better than a giant state's guns.
    
      
    
    For decades, libertarians tried sweet reason.  
    Rothbard, Hayek, Mises.  
    Milton Friedman and Ron Paul.  
    End the Fed, they said.  
    Road to Serfdom, they said.  
    But it all fell on deaf ears.  
    Even as the printer brrred.
    
      
    
    OPT OUT

    Unsound money on the other hand allows governments to buy allegiance and popularity by spending on achieving popular objectives without having to present the bill to their people. Government simply increases the money supply to finance any harebrained scheme it concocts, and the true cost of such schemes is only felt by the population in years to come when the inflation of the money supply causes prices to rise at which point the destruction of the value of the currency can be easily blamed on a mirrored of factors usually involving some nefarious plot by foreigners, bankers, local ethnic minorities, or previous or future governments.  
    unsound money is a particularly dangerous tool in the hands of modern democratic governments facing constant reelection pressure. Modern voters are unlikely to favor the candidates who are upfront about the costs and benefits of their schemes, they are far more likely to go with the scoundrels who promise a free lunch and blame the bill on their predecessors or some nefarious conspiracy. Democracy thus becomes a mass delusion of people attempting to override the rules of economics by voting themselves a free lunch and being manipulated into violent tantrums against scapegoats whenever the bill for the free lunch arrives via inflation and economic recessions.  
    Unsound money is at the heart of the modern delusion believed by most voters in those unfortunate enough to study modern macro economics at university level: that government actions have no opportunity costs, and the government can act with an omnipotent Magic wand to create the reality it wants. Whether it’s poverty reduction, morality enforcement, healthcare, education, infrastructure, reforming other countries political and economic institutions, or overriding the rules of supply and demand for any emotionally important good, most modern citizens live in a delusional dreamland where in none of these have actual costs, and all that is needed for these goals to be achieved is “political will” “strong leadership” and an absence of corruption.  
    unsound money has eradicated the notion of trade-offs and opportunity costs for the mind of individuals thinking of public affairs. It will shock the average citizen to have the startingly obvious pointed out to them: all of these nice things you want cannot be summoned cautiously out of thin air by your favorite politician, or his opponent. They all need to be provided by real people, people who need to wake up in the morning and spend days in years toiling and giving you what you want, denying themselves the chance to work on other things they might prefer to produce. So no politician has ever been elected by acknowledging this reality, the ballot box cannot overturn the fundamental scarcity of human time. Any Time governments decide to provide some thing it does not increase economic output it just means more central planning of economic output was predictable consequences.

    Today, the Bank and the Fund manage to keep a low profile in the press. When they do come up, they tend to be written off as increasingly irrelevant, accepted as problematic yet necessary, or even welcomed as helpful.  
    The reality is that these organizations have impoverished and endangered millions of people; enriched dictators and kleptocrats; and cast human rights aside to generate a multi-trillion-dollar flow of food, natural resources and cheap labor from poor countries to rich ones.

    ***Bitcoin is a check on government spending and debt, because it's a monetary asset that anyone can flee too if world governments abuse their power. Maybe it won't be a reserve asset, or fully separate governments from the money printer, but it is an escape hatch for humanity to escape to and run their own parallel economy if they fuck up too much. Before bitcoin, there was no asset that could function in this way, sure real estate and art could hold a monetary premium but they aren't liquid and infinitely divisible, they can't store all of the worlds wealth, bitcoin can. Bitcoin can store the wealth of the entire solar system and the difference is that people who hold bitcoin get more wealthy and anyone can buy in at what they can afford (vs a house) Bitcoin is the perfect check against this

    Student loans, keep kids mining fiat for their lives
    
    - Debt is specifically an instrument of control for people
    - Beyond the financial case for Bitcoin, its rise as a non-sovereign store of value will have profound geopolitical consequences. A global, non-inflationary reserve currency will force nation-states to alter their primary funding mechanism from inflation to direct taxation, which is far less politically palatable. States will shrink in size commensurate to the political pain of transitioning to taxation as their exclusive means of funding

    - Think about all of the problems in the country, and in the world, are due to state intervention
    - The massive bureaucracy, the massive debt, the wars, unfunded liabilities and ponzi scheme programs, social engineering, corporate welfare and bailouts, and manipulative systematic reliance on the state through social welfare
        - The spending and demand driven socioeconomic policies, to keep people from saving their money, encouraging them to take on loads of debt, so they have to be spinning endlessly on the hamster wheel, subservient to the banks and state.
        - Debt is a weapon, and most people don't understand
        - How does the state pay for its leviathan intervention capacity? It votes itself more money
            - Without debt, it would have to directly steal the money, which doesn't work in a democracy
            - The only way for a democratic government to become powerful is through the power of the purse, the power of debt,
            - I used to be so obsessed with the mammoth regulatory state, and there are no constitutional protections to limit this power, it grows unchecked no matter who is voted into office, our republic is seemly deteriorating

    By controlling the money supply, the government can influence the distribution of wealth and resources within society. This control extends beyond the mere issuance of money and encompasses the regulation and management of economic activities. The government’s control over money allows it to exercise authority over various aspects of people’s lives, such as employment, education, housing, and even personal freedom.

    rich countries exploit the global south through structural adjustment loans, AKA debt colonialism, impoverishing, endangering and killing millions of people; enriching dictators and kleptocrats and causing trillions of dollars of food, natural resources and cheap labor to flow from poor to rich nations annually, benefiting former colonial powers and multinational corporations.
