The way is through a new kind of Venice in cyberspace available to anyone in the world regardless of one’s wealth, class, race, religion, gender, nationality, or occupation. Where any of the billions with internet access can connect to this revolution, be a part of it, and even own a piece of it. That’s what makes this revolution so much different from the ones that came before. Whereas those achieved change through new hierarchical structures, Bitcoin will change the world through decentralization.

If you think the bitcoin companies will get a banking license, play nice with regulators, and do something mild, just to be able to jump onto some kind of retail shopping environment, you're missing the point, bitcoin is about the other six billion. Bitcoin is about the unbanked and borderless. Bitcoin is disruption on a scale that most people haven't even begun to imagine.
 
Characteristics of bitcoin’s investability include its censorship resistance and its permissionless and distributed blockchain. As the network’s infrastructure grows, bitcoin could become the most accessible and secure asset available to the public.

**Nigeria’s peer-to-peer bitcoin traded volumes of over $1.1 billion between January 2021 and June 2022 mean the West African nation is now Paxful’s largest market. Kenya, which saw traded volumes of over $325 million during the same period, now ranks as the crypto exchange’s second-largest African market, and fifth overall.**   
**Financial Exclusion Driving P2P Bitcoin Traded Volumes**  
According to the latest data from the peer-to-peer crypto exchange platform Paxful, Nigeria’s bitcoin traded volumes in the first half of 2022 nearly topped $400 million. When combined with the $760 million in trade volumes which were seen in 2021, it means the West African nation is now the crypto exchange’s biggest market globally.  
Nigeria’s growing volume of bitcoin traded via the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange comes at a time when regulators are clamping down on financial institutions that are violating the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s February 5, 2021 [directive](https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-orders-banks-to-close-accounts-of-crypto-clients-as-remittances-via-traditional-corridors-drop-by-97/). The directive bars banks and other regulated financial institutions from facilitating transactions that involve crypto entities.  
Explaining the reasons behind the surge in Africa’s P2P volumes, Paxful told Bitcoin.com News that a general lack of access to financial services across the continent was driving people toward bitcoin. Paxful said:  
For a market like Africa, where many people are underbanked and financial institutions are not as easily accessible, P2P finance provides an opportunity for financial inclusion. There’s been an explosion in Bitcoin adoption in Nigeria due to a multitude of factors: a 33% unemployment rate, an unbanked population of 38 million adults, a young and entrepreneurial community (over 75% of its population is under 35), and financial instability — such as volatility around the Naira.  
According to the P2P exchange, all these factors make “a massive case” for bitcoin, a technology which it said was “built for the masses.”

[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/path-to-a-bitcoin-standard-in-africa](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/path-to-a-bitcoin-standard-in-africa)  
The continent of Africa boasts one of the world’s most fragmented banking, payment and currency systems which adds significant complexity to simple financial tasks like the payment of a bill, sending money to loved ones or accepting money as a business. Government corruption, years of currency mismanagement and hyperinflation have resulted in debased fiat currencies that provide little value to everyday African citizens. In June, the inflation rate in Nigeria hit a 65-month [high of 18.6%](https://nairametrics.com/2022/07/15/nigerias-inflation-rate-hits-a-65-month-high-of-18-6-in-june-2022/). Worse still is the case of Zimbabwe: [Annual inflation in Zimbabwe hit 192% in June 2019 — a 13-month high for the country.](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/zimbabwe-s-currency-at-risk-of-being-rejected-local-business-group-says-1.1788708) Yet it is the very brokenness of Africa’s collective banking, payment and currency systems that embodies Africa’s greatest strength. Africa presents the perfect opportunity for a permissionless, censorship-resistant monetary system like Bitcoin to not only survive but thrive. For many African countries, the necessity of Bitcoin is proving to be the mother of invention.

When Georgio Abou Gebrael first heard about bitcoin in 2016, it sounded like a scam. But by 2019, as Lebanon plunged into a financial crisis following decades of expensive wars and bad spending decisions, a decentralized and borderless digital currency operating outside the reach of bankers and politicians sounded a lot like salvation.
 
Gebrael was an architect living in his hometown of Beit Mery, a village eleven miles due east of Beirut. He had lost his job and needed to figure out another way to quickly get ahold of cash. In the spring of 2020, Gebrael says, the banks were closed and locals were barred from withdrawing money from their accounts. Receiving cash via international wire transfer wasn’t a great option either, since these services would take U.S. dollars from the sender and give Lebanese pounds to the recipient at a much lower rate than market value according to the 27-year-old.  
“I would lose around half of the value,” explained Gebrael of the experience. “That’s why I was looking at bitcoin – it was a good way to get money from abroad.”  
Gebrael discovered a subreddit dedicated to connecting freelancers with employers willing to pay in bitcoin. The architect’s first job was to film a short commercial for a company that sold tires. Gebrael was paid $5 in bitcoin. Despite the tiny amount, he was hooked.
 
**Today, half of Gebrael’s income is from freelance work, 90% of which is paid in bitcoin.**
 
Even though accepting crypto as a payment method is prohibited under Lebanese law, businesses are actively advertising that they accept crypto payments on Instagram and other social media platforms.
 
“The use of USDT is widespread. There’s a lot of coffee shops, restaurants, and electronics stores that accept USDT as a payment, so that’s convenient if I need to spend not in fiat, but from my bitcoin savings,” explained Gebrael. “The government has much bigger problems right now than to worry about some stores accepting cryptocurrency.”

==A new documentary is showcasing how Bitcoin, beyond its role as a digital money, played a crucial role in verifying Guatemala's most recent presidential elections.==  
==The documentary, entitled "====Immutable Democracy====," delves into the innovative use of OpenTimestamps, a tool developed by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, and implemented by Guatemalan tech startup Simple Proof.==  
==OpenTimestamps utilizes cryptographic timestamps on the Bitcoin== ==blockchain====, ensuring the immutability of key documents related to the country's elections. This approach, leveraging hash functions and decentralized blockchain technology, provides a robust defense against fraud and tampering.==  
=="The reason why Bitcoin is useful for elections... is because all of these communities have one common goal, which is the truth. We can use the same system which is good at helping people come to the truth," Todd said in the video.==  
==The documentary explains the intricacies of OpenTimestamps, detailing how it cryptographically timestamps data into the Bitcoin blockchain. By anchoring information to a specific block, the tool ensures that tens of thousands of network nodes can independently verify the existence and timing of the timestamp.==  
==Guatemala, plagued by a history of political corruption, embraced Simple Proof's Immutable Backup solution to fortify the electoral process.==   
==Rafael Cordón, co-founder of Simple Proof, highlighted the application of OpenTimestamps in recording proofs of documents on the Bitcoin blockchain in a tamper-evident manner. This method not only protects official election documents but also guards against artificial intelligence and disinformation.==  
==From \<====https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/documentary-bitcoin-guatemalas-presidential-elections====\>==

Bitcoin is all about providing an escape hatch. It's about surviving economic collapse, financial repression, and protecting wealth from inflation. It's about providing a check on government run economies to preserve democracy. That's the point, it's not about getting rich.
