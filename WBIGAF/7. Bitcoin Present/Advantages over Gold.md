****First off, and most importantly, gold was captured by governments!! It objectively FAILED as a sound monetary system due to its shortcomings.**
 
- **As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either, not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose, and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel.**
 - Need to mention self custody, how the claims on gold allowed banks to devaluation their currency and depeg the gold standard 
Bitcoin was designed to specifically fix the shortcomings of gold, portability, divisibility and verifiability
 
How is $16T of gold verifiable?
 
The goal is to transfer value across space time and scales  
Gold is great at transporting across time but bad at space and scales
 
Imagine paying someone in gold, they would be like ok wtf am I supposed to do with this, how do I know its real, how do I know how much its worth? Whereas in bitcoin there are mobile wallets which verify transactions and can easily transfer with.
 
Gold is difficult and dangerous to sell in large quantities
 
Gold is defended with human life and has a history of bloodshed
 
Gold mining is way worse for the environment, and can be sourced unethically
      

Bitcoin is a fully private monetary network, for the first time in history. The true separation of money and state
   

Gold failed because it is difficult to call bluff on the paper gold market.  
It is difficult, expensive, and cumbersome to self custody gold.  
#Bitcoin  is succeeding because it is easy to call bluff on the paper BTC market.

- I would also add that Bitcoin has its own network, and can be cryptographically proven. Smart contracts can lock up Bitcoin, and you can keep track of it really easily. it was literally designed to be the perfect digital money

On this point further, is that bitcoin and gold scale custody completely opposite. Gold gets progressively harder to custody, and moving $100B of gold out of the market to verify is almost impossible. Whereas with bitcoin custody it is as easy to move out $1,000 as $1T (assuming the market cap is that big)
    
The attribute that most clearly distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat currencies and gold is its predetermined scarcity. By design, at most 21 million bitcoins can ever be created. This gives the owner of bitcoins a known percentage of the total possible supply. For instance, an owner of 10 bitcoins would know that at most 2.1 million people on earth (less than 0.03% of the world’s population) could ever have as many bitcoins as they had. Gold, while remaining quite scarce through history, is not immune to increases in supply. If it were ever the case that a new method of mining or acquiring gold became economic, the supply of gold could rise dramatically (examples include ==sea-floor== or ==asteroid mining==). Finally, fiat currencies, while only a relatively recent invention of history, have proven to be prone to constant increases in supply. Nation-states have shown a persistent proclivity to inflate their money supply to solve short-term political problems. The inflationary tendencies of governments across the world leave the owner of a fiat currency with the likelihood that their savings will diminish in value over time.

Unlike gold which fits inside a debt based system, bitcoin is a network in and of itself, it's layers provide unlimited velocity and instant transfer.

He POPS OFF  
Literally describes perfectly why bitcoin is bigger than gold
    
Being digital also makes bitcoin extremely portable, frictionless, and easily integrated into our digital world.  
Bitcoin is also programmable and can be designed around without permission. You can program money in countless of innovative ways with smart contracts and new complex financial infrastructure can be built on top of it.  
Multi party custody solutions, payment channels, atomic swaps, batch transactions, time locks, vaults, prisms, micropayments, in-game currency integration, money streaming, insurance and options smart contracts, layer three web browsers, social networks, encrypted messaging…. and so much more that hasn’t even been invented yet.  
Also with bitcoin, AI, robots, self-driving cars, drones, refrigerators, smart homes etc. can all hold and use bitcoin between themselves, a whole robot economy independent of ours.  
This isn’t possible within our current credit based monetary system, since that requires passing of personal information and creditworthiness, a regulatory and security nightmare. Bitcoin on the other hand can be settled instantly with cash finality, zapped around at the speed of light anywhere on earth.

|[CryptoMoses](https://substack.com/profile/36371285-cryptomoses)  <br>[10 hrs ago](https://bitcoinstrategy.substack.com/p/paper-bitcoin/comment/40548563)  <br>The price suppression is a serious concern (of mine & many) for sure. The approval of futures ETFs is proof that wall st (and its corrupt minion, the SEC) felt a need to go to their old stand by tool they can abuse to gain some control over markets.  <br>I believe & am hopeful the fact that BTC actually can settle when its derivatives are traded will drastically limit the power of these tools. Gold is under full control it seems because essentially no one can take delivery of vast quantities of gold that are traded in futures contracts because it is too risky, too cumbersome, and way too expensive to have this gold physically delivered.  <br>With BTC, being a digital asset, if the market gets too skewed by futures manipulation, settlement is practical and essentially lets the 'bluff to be called', which I think will keep the market more honest.  <br>This, in addition to the transparency and the ability for anyone/everyone to hold their own keys to self custody the asset, I think will undermine the power that can be exerted as seen in the metals markets.|

when someone who is on a normal wage tries to "save" in Gold. They get screwed. How? Because if you're a normal wage earner and you want to go and save say 2 grams of Gold on weekly basis. When you go to Apmex (for example) to buy 1 Gram of a Gold bar, the price is $99.34. However, when you go look at the market price of 1 Gram of Gold, the price is $58.92. That's a 68.6% premium on top of the price of Gold. This means, a normal wage earner works their ass off. To earn a salary that is not matching growth against inflation. Then gets smart enough to live below their means. Listens to an asshole like me back in the day or Kiyosaki or Maloney now and decides "I want to save in Gold". Gives $100, gets $60 of value. Then has to WAIT for Gold to go up 67% before they can BREAK EVEN. Before they "start making money". All while holding an asset where the entire industry is incentivised to keep the price low enough for normal people to buy it because the profit is at the 1gram bar, not at the 1oz bar. And there is no finality of scarcity on the underlying asset. So as the price goes up, more players enter the market, more Gold gets dug up and the price gets driven down. The little guy continues to get screwed and can never break out.

The critique that the blockchain doesn't scale is nullified by the fact that different layers could always settle back to the main chain, and if we had a scheme where it was just a few large shared UTXO's then we could theoretically settle trillions and trillions in a single block. The network scales with value in a way that gold can't, even if the main chain does have a data cap/bidding structure in a way that gold doesn't.

**In the end however, bitcoin and gold will co-exist. Similar to Silver and gold, a bi-sound money standard consisting of gold and bitcoin reserves will be common throughout the 21st century.  
The reason for this isn't just because of gold's track record or because it's culturally imbedded throughout human history, but because of tradeoffs

- Gold's tradeoffs are that it's physical, which means the cost of transfer is limited by it's weight and energy.
- Whereas bitcoin's tradeoff is it's block size, which means the number of transfers are limited but not volume.
    - If sending 1,000 BTC is equivalent to $1T then a small 40vb transaction will be able to accommodate an enormous amount of value.

With bitcoin the number of transactions are limited unlike gold.
 
When paired together however, for global neutral settlement, they complement each other. (If we're talking about large scale operations.)  
There's only one physical gold and only one digital gold. They aren't enemies they just have different tradeoffs. Combined, they're better than the sum of their parts.
