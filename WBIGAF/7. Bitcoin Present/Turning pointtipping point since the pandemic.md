- There has been a turning point since the pandemic, bitcoin is no longer speculative, once I realized it had transitioned and there’s no going back, I have been obsessed
- Debt levels soared all over the world, it was already functionally impossible for global governments to pay their debts but this was the nail in the coffin
- The surging inflation post pandemic stimulus was proof we were entering a period of fiscal dominance, where monetary policy tools would be unable to offset the inflationary pressures of governments
- UST's went no bid, they sold off in a time of crisis, the most liquid and safe asset on the planet, which are supposed to be a safe haven during a time of crisis. The fact that the treasury market broke so spectacularly was an omen of times to come, no longer are bonds the safe asset they once were, paving the way for bitcoin.
- Narrative has shifted dramatically
    - Store of value now a flight to quality
    - Bolstered by banking crisis

Damn what an article, there’s also this Alex Gladstein tweet  
“The weaponization of FX reserves and the sinking realization from big powers that they don’t actually control most of their savings will be seen as a turning point in history”

This is the end of sovereign immunity, not only are bonds a bad deal in an inflationary environment, but the precedent has now been set that those reserves can be taken away  
This has huge geopolitical consequences and marks the end of the dollar as a safe reserve asset for many countries around the world  
China is taking notice, because they hold a trillion dollars of US debt in reserves  
Holding debt in foreign reserves, may be seized by the US or EU  
Apparently the precedent had been set with Iran in 2012 but that was on a much smaller scale  
This marks the end of the US dollar based global financial system, because dollars are no longer a neutral money  
Gold and bitcoin are the only two safe haven assets  
(Also on a side note, if they can do this for an entire country, imagine what they can do to an individual or group of people)

Less than a week later, Credit Suisse Dropped this bombshell  
End of current monetary order  
-New dominance of "outside" over "inside" CB money  
-Inflation in the West  
-High treasury yields and dollar devaluation  
-Bitcoin to benefit, if it survives  
Breton Woods III
