    - Its not getting banned, the US knows it needs to establish itself as a leader in the space, it fits the freedom narrative, and states are already adopting really favorable policies. Also it has big money behind it.
    
The US gov has been auctioning off over 210K bitcoin on open auction, they wouldn't have sold 120k kilos of cocaine

B==lackRock chose to partner with Coinbase because of its scale in the market and role in providing trading, custody services, prime brokerage and reporting capabilities. The services will be available for clients of both companies.==  
==The regulatory risks from the partnership are manageable because it’s starting with Bitcoin, which has clearer regulatory status in Washington than other digital assets, said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Owen Lau, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Coinbase shares.==

In the United States, the rise of Bitcoin companies (especially miners) as economically (and soon politically) powerful entities will likely mitigate any extreme federal government response, and will result in pro-Bitcoin coalitions at the local and state level, and increasingly represented in Congress and future WH administrations. As President Biden’s Executive Order on Digital Assets (and other statements by officials such as Gary Gensler and Janet Yellen) makes clear: the United States will most likely accept Bitcoin’s gradual adoption and increasing monetization. While some incumbents and officials see Bitcoin as a threat to certain political projects (i.e., Modern Monetary Theory-inspired fiscal spending and Central Bank Digital Currency surveillance regime and capital control system), many others will come to see the inherent geopolitical advantage Bitcoin can accrue to the United States.  
…  
From a national security perspective, key decision-makers may realize that the fact that allowing Bitcoin to monetize alongside (or outpacing gold) would disproportionately benefit the U.S. (whose citizens and firms HODL potentially a majority of all Bitcoin, and whose companies and capital markets would grow in tandem). That is, while China and Russia double-down on analog gold, the U.S. can countermove to digital gold.

Interestingly, the U.S. needs to find a solution to its debt problems, and fast. Nations around the world are racing to escape the dollar-centric petrodollar system that the U.S. for decades has been able to weaponize to entrench its hegemony. The BRICS nations have announced their intentions to create a new reserve currency and there are a host of other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Argentina that are applying to become a part of this BRICS partnership. To make matters worse, the United States has $9 trillion of debt that matures in the next 24 months.  
Who is now going to buy all that debt?
 
The U.S. is once again backed into a corner like it was in the 1970s. How does the country protect its nearly 100-year hegemony as the global reserve currency issuer, and 250-year hegemony as the globe’s dominant empire?

What issue can bring together a gay Congressman from the Bronx, an environmentalist Democrat from New England, and an anti-woke Republican Governor from Florida?  
Bitcoin, apparently.  
This uncanny coalition of ideological opposites is evidence that crypto does not split evenly along party lines.

The repeal of **SAB 121** is a **pivotal moment** for Bitcoin’s integration into the traditional financial system, particularly in its role as **pristine collateral**. It removes a major regulatory roadblock that was **artificially suppressing banks from holding Bitcoin on behalf of clients** and **enabling its use in financial markets**. Here’s why this matters:
 
**1. Banks Can Now Custody Bitcoin Without Artificial Balance Sheet Penalties**

- **SAB 121**, issued by the **SEC in 2022**, forced banks to record Bitcoin and other digital assets held for customers **as liabilities on their balance sheets**.
- This **made Bitcoin custody extremely unattractive** for regulated financial institutions, as it meant they had to **hold capital reserves** against these liabilities—something not required for other assets like stocks or gold.
- With its **repeal**, banks are now **free to custody Bitcoin without this punitive accounting treatment**, making them **more likely to offer Bitcoin-related services**.

**Significance:**

- Traditional finance firms, including major banks like **JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Fidelity**, can now **securely hold Bitcoin for institutions and individuals**, leading to **broader adoption**.
- This **brings more liquidity** to Bitcoin markets and strengthens its position as a **mainstream financial asset**.
 
**2. Paves the Way for Bitcoin as Institutional Collateral**

- One of Bitcoin’s key attributes is that it is **pristine collateral**—scarce, instantly verifiable, liquid, and free from counterparty risk.
- However, under **SAB 121**, regulated institutions were discouraged from **using Bitcoin as collateral** because of **onerous balance sheet requirements**.
- **Now that it’s repealed, banks and large financial players can more easily accept Bitcoin as collateral for loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments.**

**Significance:**

- **Bitcoin-backed lending markets will expand**, enabling **institutions to borrow against BTC** instead of selling it.
- **Hedge funds and corporations can now leverage Bitcoin without balance sheet frictions**, making it a more attractive financial asset.
 
**3. Strengthens Bitcoin’s Role as a U.S. Treasury Alternative**

- Currently, U.S. Treasuries are considered the **"risk-free" collateral** of the global financial system.
- However, due to **debt monetization and inflation**, Treasuries are losing credibility as a truly **sound store of value**.
- Bitcoin is the **only alternative asset** that provides **zero counterparty risk, global liquidity, and a fixed supply**.

**Significance:**

- The repeal of **SAB 121 allows banks to hold Bitcoin more easily**, making it more viable as a **reserve asset**.
- We could see **corporations, hedge funds, and even central banks** eventually **replace Treasuries with Bitcoin** as their preferred reserve.
 
**4. Sets the Stage for Full Bitcoin Integration Into Financial Markets**

- With **SAB 121 gone**, Bitcoin is now positioned to **become an integral part of financial markets**—from derivatives to repo markets and institutional lending.
- Major financial players, **including BlackRock and Fidelity**, have already launched **Bitcoin ETFs**, which further **increase Bitcoin’s legitimacy in institutional finance**.
- The next step is the **widespread use of Bitcoin as collateral**, and this repeal is a **major step in that direction**.

**Significance:**

- Banks and financial institutions can now **treat Bitcoin like other high-quality assets**, reducing friction in its adoption.
- This brings Bitcoin **closer to being the base layer of the financial system**—something that was **previously hindered by regulatory barriers like SAB 121**.
 
**Final Thought: The Wall Street On-Ramp for Bitcoin is Now Clear**  
With **SAB 121 repealed**, banks are no longer **disincentivized from holding Bitcoin**, which opens the floodgates for **institutional adoption**.  
This move:  
✔ Enables **Bitcoin-backed lending**  
✔ Strengthens Bitcoin as **pristine collateral**  
✔ Brings Bitcoin **closer to replacing U.S. Treasuries as a reserve asset**  
✔ **Legitimizes Bitcoin in traditional finance**  
**Bottom Line:** The repeal of SAB 121 removes one of the biggest **regulatory roadblocks to Bitcoin’s financial integration**, accelerating its path to becoming **the dominant collateral asset in the global economy**. 🚀
