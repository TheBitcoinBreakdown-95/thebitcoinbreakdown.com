- Bitcoin has "immaculate conception"; it was completely fairly launched with no 'pre-mine". Furthermore, there were no VCs or other big players buying huge amounts at the start This is no longer replicable by any new cryptocurrencies even if they try to make a fair launch
- Not only was the launch fair but the distribution is also fair, and a majority of the coins exchanged hands early with ideological people who believe in the cause \> From \<[https://twitter.com/veritasini/status/1533245949702709249?s=21&t=u6CyaoADCC-tR1tXFaBLKg](https://twitter.com/veritasini/status/1533245949702709249?s=21&t=u6CyaoADCC-tR1tXFaBLKg)\>

- In 2009, a brand new form of money was created and released to the world. It was called Bitcoin. It went on to become the fastest asset in the world to reach a one trillion dollar valuation. It garnered the attention of the entire financial world. 

Premining is the mining or creation of a number of crypto coins before the cryptocurrency is launched to the public. Premining sometimes has a negative connotation due to the ability of private developers to privately mine and allocate a number coins to themselves before releasing the open source code of the currency to the public. This could lead to a feeling of lack of transparency in the digital currency offered to the public.
 
Satoshi didn’t premine. Satoshi gave everyone a two month heads up before mining the Genesis block, reaching out to the only other people who would possibly be interested in experimenting with a sovereign digital currency at the time, the cypherpunks (via public e-mail list). The whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008, then Bitcoin 0.1 software was released on January 9, 2009.
 
The Genesis Block alone was minted earlier January 3, 2009. It was unlike all other blocks (no previous block to reference) and required custom code to mine it. Satoshi included a message in the Genesis Block as a “proof of no premine.”
 
“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”- Genesis Block
 
Timestamps for subsequent blocks indicate that Nakamoto did not try to mine all the early blocks solely for himself. Before Satoshi’s invention, the concept of pre-mining didn’t exist. To be this prescient demonstrated incredible maturity.
 
The code to mine bitcoin was available on the day Satoshi began mining (other than the special purpose Genesis Block). It even had a 1-click miner in there so it was incredibly easy. Once the code was released, several individuals started mining — we know for a fact that Hal Finney was mining one day after the initial launch. Satoshi definitely wasn’t mining alone in the early days, granted the number participating was slim.
 
“Bitcoin benefited from an extremely rare set of circumstances. Because it launched in a world where digital cash had no established value, they circulated freely. That can’t be recaptured today since everyone expects coins to have value. Not only was it fair, but it was historically unique in its fairness. The immaculate conception.”  
Nic Carter
 
Satoshi wanted to signal to everyone that Bitcoin wasn’t a scam. The conservative deescalation of his mining contributions, his departure from the community, never spending any of his coins, nor using his influence for any purpose, shows that he wanted the world to make up their own mind about his project and judge it on its own terms.
 
Unlike every other founder in history, Satoshi never cashed out.
