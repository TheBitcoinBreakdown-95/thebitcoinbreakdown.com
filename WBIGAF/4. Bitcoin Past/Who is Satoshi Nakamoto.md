3. Satoshi
    1. Disappearance
    2. No leader
    3. Stories are powerful
    4. We are all satoshi
4.   
    
5. The miracle in bitcoin is that its founder left the project. Satoshi never once cashed out on his billions of dollars in wealth. Leaving bitcoin a true neutral asset, outside of the influence of mankind.
6.   
    
7. It's founder is anonymous and gone from the project. Bitcoin is the only coin with a sizeable following that is no longer controlled or heavily influenced by a founder(s), which is a potential attack vector. \<[https://twitter.com/veritasini/status/1533245949702709249?s=21&t=u6CyaoADCC-tR1tXFaBLKg](https://twitter.com/veritasini/status/1533245949702709249?s=21&t=u6CyaoADCC-tR1tXFaBLKg)\>

Bitcoin has no premine.  
Satoshi did not mess with the supply....nothing set aside for "devs" or marketing, etc.  
Satoshi understood that a clean supply was critical for a new global money.

The true origin story of Bitcoin’s appearance in the world is one of the most fascinating mysteries ever told. Yet these events all took place in the 21st century, a time when everything is recorded, and can be recalled, investigated — and verified.  
This story goes like this:  
The year is 2008. An epic, worldwide financial crisis threatens to destroy the entire global economy. The world’s governments and banks are unable to prevent it. At best, they manage to postpone the consequences, but worsen them in the process. Mass destruction looms in the air.  
Against this backdrop, seemingly out of nowhere, a mysterious figure appears.  
He calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto.  
But we never see his face.  
And we never hear his voice.  
Because there is no actual individual named Satoshi Nakamoto.  
Satoshi Nakamoto is a disguise — an online persona.  
The real person behind this identity is able to keep his actual identity secret — just like superheroes in the comics.  
Nobody asked for him to appear, or to provide any help. Nobody knew he existed. Nobody knows his true identity.  
Yet, out of nowhere, he shows up. And, he brings with him an invention, which he calls Bitcoin.  
He explains this invention’s workings in a short, flawlessly written document. In this paper, he also presents a solution to a problem that mathematicians and computer scientists claimed could not be solved. They had proven that it could not be solved.  
Yet despite the theoretical impossibility of solving this problem, Nakamoto provides a solution that does work in practice. And it is an essential part of how his invention functions.  
The invention itself works as a new form of money, unlike any that came before it. It is an intangible, yet incorruptible money, ruled by no person, no institution, no company and no government. It is rules without any rulers.  
For a couple of years, the mysterious Satoshi maintains the system, evangelizes the idea, and finds volunteers to run and tweak it alongside him. And then — poof — quietly, he simply disappears. It’s an exit with no fanfare, not even an announcement. He merely leaves, eventually sending a final email to one developer saying he has moved on to other things, and that Bitcoin is in good hands. He is never heard from again.  
What becomes of this invention? Abandoned by its creator, is it now doomed?  
Hardly! Despite having no leader, no employees, no funding and no marketing, Bitcoin roars to life and spreads throughout the world.  
It is not a democracy. It is not a corporation. It is not a charity. Its fundamental rules cannot be altered. It is an invention unlike any that ever came before it. As such, it is [indescribable](https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/why-bitcoin-is-not-like-anything-youve-ever-seen-before-9a7e09b5cc0f)with existing words. New ones need to be created to attempt to explain it.  
And its creation is itself hard to describe. Nobody can quite explain how in one single act Satoshi was able to simultaneously address the unsolvable mathematical problem and build a system that could run itself without requiring regular maintenance. Bitcoin can and in fact does run itself. Moreover, the system is accessible to every single human being on earth — nobody needs to go through a sign-up process to use it, and nobody can prevent anyone else from using it. And the system itself cannot be stopped — even the most powerful governments in the world are powerless to stop it. It is a system engineered to essentially last forever. Its design can accommodate running for billions of years without ever running out of storage space or exhausting user IDs, or even requiring any significant upgrade. Its continued operation relies only on the eternal and unchanging laws of math and physics.  
Bitcoin does so [many things that no invention before it could](https://tomerstrolight.medium.com/why-people-wonder-if-bitcoin-is-alien-technology-f9fda5b018b). “How did Satoshi do it?” people wonder. But, because he’s vanished, no one can ask him how he did it.  
In vanishing, Satoshi takes with him these secrets. But he leaves behind, abandoned, approximately one million bitcoins that he himself earned in its earliest days, long before the coins were worth anything to others.  
We cannot ask _him_ why he invented Bitcoin, how he remained hidden, why he disappeared, how he came up with these ideas, or where he found the strength to remain hidden after his disappearance — either at times when Bitcoin was being attacked and looked like it needed his help, or when his million coins reached a value of a billion dollars, and then ten billion dollars.  
We can only ask _ourselves_ questions about Satoshi: What kind of person was this mysterious creator of Bitcoin who solved a problem thought to be impossible to solve, who kept his identity hidden from every single person and agency in the world, who built an unstoppable and indestructible system, and who mysteriously vanished and turned his back on extreme fame, power, and fortune — the rewards so often sought by so many.
   

"Satoshi has done a wonderful job of creating an anonymous alter ego. Twelve years later no one has been able to unmask his Halloween disguise. In a world where seemingly the answer to any mystery, the solution to any paradox, is within a few clicks of a mouse, creating an impenetrable anon had to take wit and meticulous planning. Satoshi was always careful as to leave scant traceable personal clues in his writing.
 
In colleges where cryptocurrency will be taught in the future, a chapter dedicated to Satoshi will be taught to students who wish to learn more about how Bitcoin was invented. There would be endless questions about who he was and why he is unknown,

But how is it possible for one of the most famous people in the world to remain so anonymous?

Bitcoin is money but it's also a clock, a new kind of time
 
SATOSHI’S TREASURE
 
Satoshi gave the Earth Bitcoin. He watched over it until it needed no father or leader, and then he set it free by disappearing forever. When he did so_,_ he left behind a treasure of approximately one million bitcoins. He left them out in plain sight. Everyone can see them. Every bitcoin is visible to every person in the world who looks at its public record, commonly known as the blockchain. The value of these coins grows colossally as the value of Bitcoin does. It is the biggest pile of bitcoins in the world that belongs to any one entity and it will almost certainly remain the biggest forever. If Bitcoin becomes all the money in the world, it will be the largest pile of money in the world. Yet nobody can take any of it. It is in plain sight yet it is untouchable!  
You can imagine then the lust and the greed that this pile of money, sitting in plain sight, will incite in those who long for wealth, or fame, or power. It will drive them mad with lust and greed. They will spend many hours, days, or even years trying to figure out how to get their hands on some or all of it.  
It is a loud siren declaring to those who hunger for power “Here lies Satoshi’s legendary treasure — take it, if you can.”  
Yet, as this fortune grows, it will serve as an example to all of humankind that _pure_money belongs only to the one who earned it. And pure money gives its owner the freedom to do with it as they choose.  
And this pile is Satoshi’s money. And what Satoshi chose to do with it was not to buy anything material with it. His choice was not to use it to become famous and have people tell him how great he is. His choice was not to use it to become a powerful man on the world stage influencing policies that affect the lives of others.  
Instead, He chose to use this money for another purpose. He chose to make it into an eternal monument dedicated to the human spirit. To stand there, forever, to show that one person can accomplish many things that others have proclaimed to be impossible. It stands there, _forever_, to show that one person can stand up to widely held beliefs and prove them false. It shows that one person can ignite a movement to question the necessity, validity, and authority of the most powerful entities in the world. It stands there — forever — to show that a person can in fact sacrifice wealth, power, and fame to create and do what is morally good. It stands there, **forever**, to say “Humanity can make good things that last forever”.

The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto is not a story the Sith would tell you.
 
And yet it is one of the most fascinating legends ever told.
 
It's the story of a cryptic computer scientist, an unknown person or a group of people whose invention has changed human civilization forever.
 
Unlike many legends of past, this story takes place in the modern, digital age, where everything is tracked and logged. Satoshi's communications are publicly available to read, and yet the details around her identity are still shrouded in mystery.
 
Let's turn back the clocks to the year 2008.
 
In the midst of a global financial crisis, the worst economic emergency since the great depression, and *almost* the most cataclysmic economic event in the history of mankind.
 
A shadowy figure quietly emerges.  
They call them-self Satoshi Nakamoto.
 
To calm markets and suppress a meltdown, emergency measures are taken by world governments, flooding the economy to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts.
 
Our political and economic leaders barely save us from catastrophe, as the entire world is thrust into recession. Global debt reaches record levels, with its consequences merely postponed…
 
The date is October 31st.  
On a Halloween night, against the backdrop of this global crisis, this mad computer scientist quietly published the instructions to a new kind of money. A digital money, an unstoppable money, ruled by no human being. An invention they call bitcoin.
 
“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  
-Satoshi Nakamoto
 
In a time where overleveraged financial institutions had risked the solvency of the global economy, the seeds of rebellion were planted. A revolutionary new economic system was born.
 
For you see, this unknown inventor of bitcoin, was a Cypherpunk.
 
The Cypherpunks were a group of digital liberty advocates and anarchists. Computer scientists who were terrified of a future Orwellian surveillance state.
 
They decided to take freedom into their own hands, creating technology no government or corporation could stop.
 
And independent money was their holy grail.
 
The Cypherpunks had been diligently working towards the perfect digital money for decades. Their aim was to free humanity from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and to move money without permission and without censorship. The separation of money and state.
 
Standing on the shoulders of the Cypherpunk giants, Satoshi had a breakthrough.
 
No one ever meets this person. No one even knows if they are a single person or a group. No one ever hears her voice and no one ever sees his face.
 
That's because there's no one actually named Satoshi Nakamoto. It's a pseudonym, a disguise, a mask.
 
Like a real life superhero, they conceal their identity from the world. All communication was done digitally through forum posts and email. Through meticulous planning, evasive linguistic tactics, and unpredictable posting times, Satoshi left no traceable personal clues in their writing.
 
In their whitepaper published on that fateful Halloween, Satoshi presents a solution to a computer science dilemma, a problem once thought impossible to solve.
 
Simultaneously reinventing one of the oldest technologies in human civilization, and solving a multi-thousand-year-old trust problem, with the first accounting innovation in over 700 years, Satoshi created a trust machine that runs on its own without human involvement. Eliminating the need to trust in institutions like banks, corporations or governments.
 
Satoshi discovered a way to put physics into the internet, to recreate the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy, within cyberspace. Satoshi discovered a new form of time, a decentralized clock, that ticks for eternity. Satoshi discovered a way to give everyone on earth access to immutable money, a revolution in property rights.
 
Her invention has profound consequences for the history of mankind. Completely altering our relationship with technology and the future of the internet.
 
For a couple of years, this mysterious computer scientist worked with volunteers to bootstrap the project. Fixing bugs and tweaking the code. And then without notice or announcement…disappears. Like a ghost.
 
It's a departure without a display. Satoshi doesn't broadcast his exit, she simply leaves. They stop answering questions and emails, and stop participating in discussions.
 
No one ever finds out who they are, where they came from or where they went. Satoshi remains unknown to this very day.
 
But with its creator gone, what is to become of this digital money project? Does it fade away into obscurity? Quite the opposite, bitcoin jolts to life, its thunder is heard around the world.
 
Bitcoin went on to become the fastest trillion dollar valuation of any asset in history, at an adoption pace faster than the internet itself. Spawning an entirely new asset class and industry, and tens of thousands of other projects.
 
The invention of bitcoin marked a fundamental breakthrough in cryptography, computer science, information theory, economics, and fintech.
 
Now the largest supercomputer on earth, bitcoin is completely immortal. It can’t be shut down, it can’t be hacked, it can’t be changed, and it can’t be controlled. Even the most powerful governments, corporations and institutions in the world are powerless to stop it.
 
It is a self-running software program designed to last forever.
 
No one knows how it’s possible for Satoshi to both solve this unsolvable computer science problem and build an all-powerful, self-sustaining monetary system at the same time.
 
To be a polymath, specialized across multiple academic disciplines, and yet evade detection. The field of experts in distributed systems engineering is so small you would think it would be simple to nail them down, and yet there have been no definitive leads.
 
Is Satoshi and alien? A time traveler? A secret government organization? A libertarian nerd in his mother’s basement? It’s very possible that Satoshi isn’t even alive anymore. It's been well over a decade and still no one can unmask her Halloween disguise.
 
By disappearing Satoshi left behind ultimate fame, power, and fortune. Adding to the mystery.
 
It's estimated that Satoshi is in direct control of over _one million bitcoins_, and yet the coins have never been touched. Satoshi can anonymously move or sell their bitcoin whenever they want.
 
The fact that this treasure has sat dormant since 2010 leads many to believe that it's unlikely Satoshi is ever coming back. If someone had access to that kind of money, they probably would have used some of it by now.
 
Instead, Satoshi's treasure sits untouched as a monument to their selflessness.
 
Satoshi's treasure is becoming the largest pile of money in history. In only a few years Satoshi is expected to be the richest person in the world, as the value of their fortune surpasses $300 billion. It's predicted that this treasure surpasses a trillion dollars in value as soon as the 2030's.
 
Because bitcoin is completely transparent, Satoshi's treasure is available for all to see, and yet remains completely untouchable. To compute even one of Satoshi's keys would take until the heat death of the universe.
 
Satoshi's treasure lies there mocking the old guard of money, the financial institutions he so adamantly dismayed. It lies there as a testament to the power of the individual, proving that anything is possible. And it lies there taunting those who are driven by greed, selfish minds who only seek out fortune and fame, proving that humans are capable of throwing it all away for the good of humanity.   It lies there forever jeering: "Here lies Satoshi’s legendary treasure — take it, if you can"
 
…
 
For many years to come, the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will continue to incite awe and astonishment as people first learn about bitcoin's humble origins. People from around the world will marvel at the genius of Satoshi and speculate on their identity and motivation. Classes will be taught on bitcoin and the chapter dedicated to Satoshi will inspire generation after generation.
 
We will probably never know who invented bitcoin. The moral of the story isn't to speculate on who Satoshi is, but to understand that it doesn't matter.
 
Satoshi gave bitcoin as a gift to humanity. We run bitcoin and we decide it's future. There's no one in charge now, bitcoin belongs to everyone. We are all equal participants in the network.
 
We are all Satoshi.
