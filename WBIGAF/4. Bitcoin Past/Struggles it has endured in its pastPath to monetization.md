Beautiful bitcoin history
 
BTC is a story of incredible resilience. They rejected it on the mailing list, banned it at corpos, tried to install a dictator, fire the devs, copy it, co-opt miners. They painted it as poison, waste, drugs, gambling. They blocked banking, funds, trading. But they didn’t stop us

[JPMorgan](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/jpm?mod=article_chiclet) CEO Jamie Dimon did just that Wednesday, urging Congress to [“close it down”](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-crypto-jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-regulation-b19dc76d?mod=article_inline) when asked how to tackle crypto’s uses for illegal activity.  
Unfortunately for Dimon, and perhaps others, it’s very much here to stay. Crypto assets have proved they are capable of bouncing back from everything thrown at them–the collapse of FTX and conviction of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Binance’s record $4.3 billion fine for money laundering violations, intense regulatory scrutiny, and all the rest.  
It may look like a boxer on the ropes at times, but it never hits the canvas and it always comes out swinging.

A list of crypto exchanges and blowups

-   
    
- Bitcoin has been around longer than any other cryptocurrency and has not gone down or suffered any attacks (to the blockchain itself), so it has the longest proven history of being secure. - Bitcoin is anti fragile
- [https://medium.com/@MiguelCuneta_21450/its-too-late-nothing-can-stop-the-bitcoin-protocol-738047bb5201](https://medium.com/@MiguelCuneta_21450/its-too-late-nothing-can-stop-the-bitcoin-protocol-738047bb5201)
    - Running non-stop for nine years, with almost zero financial loss on the chain itself, Bitcoin has become the most reliable and secure financial network in the world. When you send a valid Bitcoin transaction, you can bet the farm on it that it will be sent and that it will be received by your intended recipient. It’s right up there with death and taxes.
    - It has been subject to every kind of attack ranging from network attacks, spamming, social attacks, government crackdown, FUD attacks, hash power and mining attacks, contentious hard fork attacks, and more recently, brand hijacking from unscrupulous groups that spend exorbitant amounts of money to try and destroy Bitcoin. All the attacks have failed, and the network became more resilient as a result.
    - **Protocol Flaw**
    
    One of the earliest risks was that there was a fatal flaw on the protocol level of Bitcoin. In 2009–2010, when Bitcoin was in its infancy, people were not really sure about how robust the software would be, simply because it has not faced any major challenges yet. By 2011, the best engineers and cryptographers in the world knew that this risk had been reduced to almost zero.
    
    - **Government Risks**
    - Going into 2013, during the second Bitcoin hype-cycle, the greatest risk was from the governments of the world — what if the US banned Bitcoin? What if governments made it illegal to own Bitcoin? The New York Bitlicense set an ominous precedent, but by the end of 2013, at least in free and democratic countries around the world, this risk had gone down to zero as well.
    - **Secondary Market Challenges**
    - And then there was the Mt. Gox hack in 2014. What was then the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchange in the world had been hacked, losing over half a billion dollars, and compromising the integrity of the fledgling cryptocurrency markets. The risk of losing the valuable secondary markets for trading Bitcoin was looming over everyone’s heads, but common sense prevailed, and by 2017 we already had numerous regulated and liquid cryptocurrency exchange platforms everywhere in the world, with Bitcoin as the crypto-reserve currency, following industry best practices and better security protocols.
    - **Social and Technical Scalability Risks**
    - The last challenge Bitcoin faced last year, in 2017, was the risk of a major hard fork splitting the network and ultimately compromising its integrity. A contentious hard fork eventually did happen, but it did not have the expected results. After the fork, Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs, rising over 1000% in just three short months. The social scalability of Bitcoin had been tested, and it passed with flying colors. The users, nodes, and miners that make up the Bitcoin network had chosen the version of Bitcoin that they wanted to support, and the market responded positively.
    - Although the root cause of the split in the network was transactional scalability, Bitcoin still works well today, with transaction fees at all-time lows because base layer improvements like Segwit have reached 30% adoption.

The biggest attack in Bitcoin’s history came in 2017 at the software level. That spring a handful of the most important industry actors gathered and signed what is called the New York Agreement. The authors boasted more than 83% of the global mining hashpower1, more than 50 total companies, more than 20 million wallets, and a huge share of the payment infrastructure. It was an alliance between Chinese miners, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street, and their goal was to change Bitcoin to allow it to process more transactions per second, at the cost of sacrificing decentralization and the ability of users to audit the monetary supply from home.
 
Despite the odds, a handful of grassroots activists ended up building a movement that stunningly defeated this New York alliance. By November 2017, the corporate “SegWit2X” plan was dead, and Bitcoin remained decentralized. The lesson from these “scaling wars” is that neither miners nor corporations control Bitcoin. Yes, miners process transactions, and developers propose upgrades to the software, but tens of thousands of users running nodes actually decide what transactions are valid and what software version is adopted.

There are already many exciting chapters in Bitcoin’s short story. Consider the episodes where nations like China, Turkey, and India outlaw it. Or when in America, powerful politicians seek to ban it. There’s the attempts by leaders of financial institutions to use their authority and influence to harm and discredit Bitcoin. Yet Bitcoin survives all these attacks. It is made stronger by them.  
The battles do not end there. The heads of the world’s largest banks take note of Bitcoin. They laugh at it at first. Then they vilify it. Then they welcome what they think is its underlying technology. Slowly, they begin to accept it, but they remain cautious.  
Huge corporations like Facebook attempt to create substitutes, mustering their huge audiences, capital reserves, and reputation. They fail.  
Entrepreneurs and plenty of charlatans pretending to be entrepeneurs try building copycat systems. They obtain the backing of large venture capital firms. They spend hundreds of millions to market their alternatives. But these come and go like the seasons. Bitcoin is often imitated and often attacked, but never duplicated or destroyed.  
Were it not for the fact that Bitcoin´s origin story is fully documented and so thoroughly and provably verifiable, critics could easily dismiss this story as an unsubstantiated myth given how many attacks Bitcoin has reportedly survived.

==Bitcoin, despite its short existence, has weathered enough trials in the market that there is a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon. Furthermore, the== ==Lindy effect== ==suggests that the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society’s confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. In other words, the societal trust of a new monetary good is asymptotic in nature, as is illustrated in the graph below:==

==If Bitcoin exists for 20 years, there will be near-universal confidence that it will be available forever, much as people believe the Internet is a permanent feature of the modern world.==

The fact that bitcoin survived 2022 and is back with levels not seen in a year, WHILE Coinbase and Binance are getting sued, is a testament to how resilient bitcoin really is. It Wont Die. And everyone is catching on.

Fifteen years in, bitcoin has now withstood a barrage of stress tests that have both demonstrated and increased its resilience, an incomplete list of which includes: four 80%+ price drawdowns; massive exchange hacks, bankruptcies, and rugpulls; “bans” by large sovereigns like China; and contentious hard forks of its code. These stressors help illustrate bitcoin’s antifragility, and each shock it survives boosts confidence in the network and the likelihood that bitcoin will continue to survive, thus drawing in more users and further increasing resilience in a virtuous cycle (the [“Lindy effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)). This phenomenon can be directly observed in bitcoin’s on-chain data through “[HODL Waves](https://unchained.com/hodlwaves),” which illustrate a consistently growing proportion of bitcoin buyers turning into long-term holders:
   
47. [Don't Buy Bitcoin! | Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon | #BitcoinHardTalk Ep.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suk1YNRmuxQ)
48. Mt. Gox Collapse: One of the most notable examples mentioned is the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange. In 2014, Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy after revealing that approximately 850,000 bitcoins (valued at over $450 million at the time) were missing, presumed stolen. This event was a major crisis for Bitcoin, causing a significant drop in its price and shaking investor confidence. Many feared that this could be the end of Bitcoin, as it highlighted the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency exchanges and the lack of regulatory oversight.
49. Regulatory Challenges: Bitcoin has also faced numerous regulatory challenges. Governments and financial institutions around the world have been grappling with how to deal with cryptocurrencies. Some countries have imposed strict regulations or outright bans, citing concerns over illegal activities, financial stability, and investor protection. For instance, China has repeatedly cracked down on cryptocurrency trading and mining, citing financial risks and energy consumption concerns.
50. Post-Mt. Gox Recovery: Following the Mt. Gox incident, Bitcoin's ecosystem began to mature. The incident led to calls for better security measures at exchanges and heightened awareness among investors about the risks involved. Over time, the price of Bitcoin not only recovered but surged to new highs, indicating strong investor confidence and the perceived value of Bitcoin as an asset.
51. Adaptation to Regulatory Changes: In response to regulatory challenges, the Bitcoin community and related businesses have adapted by seeking jurisdictions with favorable regulations, improving security standards, and implementing measures to comply with legal requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. This adaptability has allowed Bitcoin to continue thriving despite varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny across different countries.
52. Technological and Community Resilience: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that no single failure or regulatory action can easily destroy the network. The Bitcoin network is maintained by a global community of developers, miners, and users, making it resilient to localized disruptions. This decentralization also contributes to Bitcoin's appeal as a censorship-resistant and borderless digital currency.
53. Market Resilience: The market resilience of Bitcoin is evident in its price history. Despite numerous price corrections and periods of high volatility, Bitcoin has consistently gained in value over the long term. This trend reflects growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and an investment asset, alongside increasing interest from institutional investors.

Conclusion  
In summary, while Bitcoin has faced significant challenges, including major security breaches and regulatory hurdles, its decentralized nature, community-driven development, and adaptability have allowed it to not only survive these challenges but often emerge stronger. This resilience has been a key factor in Bitcoin's growth and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate financial asset.
