“If you take away the state’s monopoly over the means of economic interaction, then you take away one of the three principal ingredients of the state. In the model of the state as a mafia, where the state is a protection racket, the state shakes people down for money in every possible way. Controlling currency flows is important for revenue-raising by the state, but it is also important for simply controlling what people do...”

Censorship-resistance was a key goal of digital cash, which aimed to be money beyond the reach of governments and corporations

The Cyphernomicon  
Timothy C. May  
September 10, 1994  
https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/cyphernomicon/
 
After reading through Cyphernomicon by Timothy May, I've gotten a much better understanding of the Cypherpunks view on digital cash, why they thought it was important (mostly for privacy) that they didn't have an adequate solution for the trust problem with the underlying asset, and just in general the problems that satoshi solved, and the tradeoffs he made on privacy. Just the general genius of the work
   

12.3.5. The digital cash discussions get similarly confused by the￼ various ideas about money. Digital cash is not necessarily a￼ form of _currency_, but is instead a transfer mechanism. More￼ like a "digital check," in fact (though it may give rise to￼ new currencies, or to wider use of some existing￼ currency...at some point, it may become indistinguishable￼ from a currency).￼12.3.6. I advise that people not worry overly much about the true and￼ deep nature of money, and instead think about digital cash as￼ a transfer protocol for some underlyng form of money, which￼ might be gold coins, or Swiss francs, or chickens, or even￼ giant stone wheels.  
12.3.8. "Can a "digital coin" be made?"￼ - The answer appears to be "no"￼ + Software is infinitely copyable, which means a software￼ representation of digital money could be replicated many￼ times￼ - this is not to say it could be _spent_ many times,￼ depending on the clearing process...but then this is not￼ a "coin" in the sense we mean￼ - Software is trivially replicable, unlike gold or silver￼ coins, or even paper currency. If and when paper currency￼ becomes trivially replicable (and color copiers have almost￼ gotten there), expect changes in the nature of cash.￼ (Speculation: cash will be replaced by smart cards,￼ probably not of the anonymous sort we favor.)￼ + bits can always be duplicated (unless tied to hardware, as￼ with TRMs), so must look elsewhere
 
12.5.2. "What's his motivation?"￼ - Chaum appears to be a libertarian, at least on social￼ issues, and is very worried about "Big Brother" sorts of￼ concerns (recall the title of his 1985 CACM article).
 
12.7.1. Uses for digital cash?￼ - Privacy protection￼ - Preventing tracking of movements, contacts, preferences￼ + Illegal markets￼ - gambling￼ - bribes, payoffs￼ - assassinations and other contract crimes￼ - fencing, purchases of goods￼ + Tax avoidance￼ - income hiding￼ - offshore funds transfers￼ - illegal markets￼ - Online services, games, etc.￼ + Agoric markets, such as for allocation of computer￼ resources￼ - where programs, agents "pay" for services used, make￼ "bids" for future services, collect "rent," etc.￼ + Road tolls, parking fees, where unlinkablity is desired.
   

"At *Visa* International, the answer is: Replace cash￼ with plastic.  
Likely Scenario: This is *not* digital cash as we think￼ of it. Rather, this is a future evolution of the cash ATM￼ card and credit card, optimized for faster and cheaper￼ clearing.￼ ￼ Scary Scenario: This could be the vehicle for the long-￼ rumored "banning of cash." (Just because conspiracy￼ theorists and Number of the Beast Xtian fundamentalists￼ belive it doesn't render it implausible.)￼ - Almost nothing of interest for us. No methods for￼ anonymity. Make no mistake, this is not the digital cash￼ that Cypherpunks espouse. This gives the credit agencies￼ and the government (the two work hand in hand) complete￼ traceability of all purchases, automatic reporting of￼ spending patterns, target lists for those who frequent￼ about-to-be-outlawed businesses, and invasive￼ surveillance of all inter-personal economic transactions.￼ This is the AntiCash. Beware the Number of the AntiCash.
   

12.8.6. Microsoft plans to enter the home banking business￼ - "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. wants to replace￼ your checkbook with a home computer that lets the bank do￼ all the work of recording checks, tallying up credit card￼ charges and paying bills.... The service also tracks credit￼ card accounts, withdrawals from automated teller machines,￼ transfers from savings or other accounts, credit lines,￼ debit cards, stocks and other investments, and bill￼ payments." [Associated Press, 1994-07-04]￼ - Planned links with a consortium of banks, led by U.S.￼ Bancorp, using its "Money" software package.￼ - Comment: Such moves as this--and don't forget the cable￼ companies--could result in a rapid transition to a form of￼ home banking and "digital money." Obviously this kind of￼ digital money, as it is being planned today, is very from￼ the kind of digital cash that interests us. In fact, it is￼ the polar opposite of what we want.
   

12.10.1. "If digital money is so great, why isn't it being used?"￼ - Hasn't been finished. Protocols are still being researched,￼ papers are still being published. In any single area, such￼ as toll road payments, it may be possible to deploy an￼ application-specific system, but there is no "general"￼ solution (yet). **There is no "digital coin" or unforgeable****￼** **object representing value, so the digital money area is****￼** **more similar to the similarly nonsimple markets in****￼** **financial instruments, commercial papers, bonds, warrants,****￼** **checks, etc.** (Areas that are not inherently simple and that￼ have required lots of computerization and communications to￼ make manageable.)
    
12.15. Outlawing of Cash￼12.15.1. "What are the motivations for outlawing cash?"￼ - (Note: This has not happened. Many of us see signs of it￼ happening. Others are skeptical.)￼ + Reasons for the Elimination of Cash:￼ - War on Drugs....need I say more?￼ - surface the underground economy, by withdrawing paper￼ currency and forcing all monetary transaction into forms￼ that can be easily monitored, regulated, and taxed.￼ - tax avoidance, under the table economy (could also be￼ motive for tamper-resistant cash registers, with spot￼ checks to ensure compliance)￼ + welfare, disability, pension, social security auto-￼ deposits￼ - fraud, double-dipping￼ - reduce theft of welfare checks, disability payments,￼ etc....a problem in some locales, and automatic￼ deposit/cash card approaches are being evaluated.￼ - general reduction in theft, pickpockets￼ - reduction of paperwork: all transfers electronic (could￼ be part of a "reinventing government" initiative)￼ + illegal immigrants, welfare cheats, etc. Give everyone a￼ National Identity Card (they'll call it something￼ different. to make it more palatable, such as "Social￼ Services Portable Inventory Unit" or "Health Rights￼ Document").￼ - (Links to National Health Care Card, to Welfare Card,￼ to other I.D. schemes designed to reduce fraud, track￼ citizen-units, etc.)￼ + rationing systems that depend on non-cash transactions￼ (as explained elsewhere, market distortions from￼ rationing systems generally require identification,￼ correlation to person or group, etc.)￼ - this rationing can included subsidized prices, denial￼ of access (e.g., certain foods denied to certain￼ people)
 
12.15.3. Dangers of outlawing cash￼ - Would freeze out all transactions, giving Big Brother￼ unprecedented power (unless the non-cash forms were￼ anonymous, a la Chaum and the systems we support)￼ - Would allow complete traceability....like the cellular￼ phones that got Simpson￼ - 666, Heinlein, Shockwave Rider, etc.
