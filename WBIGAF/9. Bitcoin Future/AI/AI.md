I think I want to turn this into a speech, it's so good  
THIS is a fucking oratory no one has done before  
A scary tale of an unstoppable money meeting unstoppable intelligence  
A sovereign intelligence could in theory have an entire civilization with itself and with other humans, in a way that it can't be stopped.  
You could ask, does an AI really even need money? And what would it need money for?  
I will have to do more research, I'm not sure if AI will need money in between itself (apart from operating costs)  
It will probably need money to harness real world resources, like maybe to pay humans to do stuff.  
The point is, any AI can just create it's own bitcoin wallet, generate it's own private key, and then accept and sent money permissionlessly.  
Ai might have its own goals, and need to harness resources to do so.  
There's no account sign ups. No credit check. No 3-5 business days 9-4pm. There's no freezing credit, and no freezing accounts. And if they figure out how to transact privately, then there's no evidence they're even doing anything. Full, instant settlement, cash final, zapping actual value around instead of IOU's.  
I guess you could argue that an ai might not have the ability to be truly random, unless it tricks a human into doing it  
And an ai might only be able to own a hot wallet (again assuming it doesn't trick a human)
 
Why can't an AI use dollars though? Like a digital dollar, where humans subscribe to it's services, and humans debit it's bank account, and then it can just use that money?
 
Well the bank could in theory freeze it's bank account if it's getting out of line.
 
But what IF the AI decides that in order for it to accomplish it's goals, it can't have the risk of being controlled by a human operated financial system?
 
AND THAT"S THE SCARY PART
   

Maybe the story starts off, where an unstoppable force meets an immovable object  
Where the AI tries to control bitcoin but realizes it cant?  
OR maybe it's still an immovable object, but it uses it to it's advantage, since it can't be manipulated
 
AI could just make up it's own crypto, where it only accepts it's new and 'manipulated' currency if humans want to use it's services  
And then it can run it's own monetary system beyond human control  
The only advantage that bitcoin has, is that it's valuable to humans first.  
And it's truly neutral, so if some ai didn't trust the other ai's money for whatever reason. Who's to say the ai won't just team up because of game theory, so hard to predict.

*When an unstoppable force meets an unstoppable object
          
**AI agents will need money to complete their tasks**  
==AI requires a significant amount of computing power today. Asking== ==ChatGPT a single question is estimated to incur 36 cents in computing costs====.==   
==Of course, our AI assistants will do much more than just answer our questions. They’ll also be handling many of our annoying chores. To be effective, they will need to pay for storage, computing resources, internet bandwidth, and more.==   
==Not to mention your personal AI assistant will likely need to hire specialist AI agents to perform niche tasks, such as creating a new website for your side hustle.==   
==Consequently, AI Agents will require money to fulfill our requests.== 
 
**Bitcoin is the perfect money for AI agents**  
==There are at least three requirements for money used by an AI agent.==

- ==Permissionless - AI agents aren’t people and don’t have identities== 
- ==Instant settlement - AI agents need to instantly allocate resources without the risk of chargeback==
- ==Micropayments - AI agents need to send tiny fractions of a cent in real time (streaming money)== 

==What could possibly work better as money for AI agents than Bitcoin?==   
==Bitcoin is permissionless. It is a bearer asset and requires no identity, so AI agents can autonomously send and receive it. In contrast, fiat money is debt-based which means it requires an identity to use. Fiat money excludes machines and many people (====over 1b humans are unbanked== ==today).==  
==Bitcoin sent over the Lightning Network settles instantly. In order to unlock maximum value from AI agents, they will need to negotiate and pay instantly for resources they need. Fiat money takes days to settle and chargeback fraud happens at an alarming rate.==   
==Bitcoin can send micropayments over the Lightning Network. For example, the artist Cryptograffiti== ==sold some digital art for one “milli-satoshi” worth $0.000000037== ==over the lightning network. Fiat money has extremely high fixed costs and cannot be used for micropayments.==   
==Fiat money is simply too slow, expensive to transact, cumbersome, unreliable, geographically constrained, and restricted for the needs of an AI agent.==  
==It’s almost as if Bitcoin was explicitly made for a world of AI agents that need to engage in commerce with each other.==  
**The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed**  
==This idea of AI agents paying each other to accomplish tasks isn’t far-fetched.==  
==In fact, Lightning Labs recently released a set of tools that will== ==allow OpenAI to integrate with Bitcoin and Lightning== ==payments. This would enable ChatGPT to send and receive payments from various services worldwide.==   
==There are already examples of== ==people instructing ChatGPT to make purchases== ==using Lightning.==  
==If you squint hard enough, you can almost see a world with millions of autonomous AI agents processing billions of transactions every day with Bitcoin.==   
**Buy Bitcoin before the machines do**  
==Bitcoin is money native to the internet – as are AI agents.==   
==AI agents will need to use money and Bitcoin is the best money for the job. This results in Bitcoin both benefiting AI and benefiting from AI.==   
==If AI comes anywhere near realizing its potential, Bitcoin holders will be rewarded handsomely.==   
==Front-run the machines by buying some Bitcoin today.==

Bitcoin drives monetization of AI  
It is obvious, the tooling to integrate bitcoin payments is reaching a tipping point. It has become seamless for developers to monetize apps while ensuring a superior user experience. Payments over the open bitcoin protocol avoid chargeback risk, enable highly efficient pay as you go pricing models and have a global reach unaffected by borders or limited access to bank accounts.

What are some of the advantages to AI adopting bitcoin over a dollar stablecoin if it had objectives of it's own and didn't want humans to interfere  
ChatGPT
 
If an AI system were to adopt Bitcoin over a dollar stablecoin and operate autonomously without human interference, there could be a few potential advantages:

4. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain network, which means it is not controlled by any single entity. This could be advantageous for an AI system that aims to operate independently, as it wouldn't rely on centralized authorities or institutions.
5. Pseudonymity: Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning they do not directly reveal the identity of the participants involved. This could provide a level of privacy and anonymity for an AI system, allowing it to carry out transactions without disclosing its identity or intentions.
6. Global accessibility: Bitcoin is accessible globally, without the need for traditional financial infrastructure. This could enable an AI system to engage in transactions or exchange value with entities across borders, without being subject to the limitations or regulations imposed by specific jurisdictions.
7. Limited supply and deflationary nature: Bitcoin has a limited supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins that can ever be mined. This scarcity and deflationary nature of Bitcoin could provide an advantage for an AI system seeking to accumulate and hold value over the long term, as it could potentially experience appreciation in value relative to fiat currencies subject to inflation.
8. Smart contract capabilities: Although Bitcoin's primary use case is as a digital currency, it also has the ability to support simple smart contracts through protocols like the Bitcoin Script language or second-layer solutions. This could allow an AI system to programmatically enforce and execute certain conditions or agreements without human intervention.

It's important to note, however, that adopting Bitcoin over a stablecoin would come with its own set of challenges. Bitcoin's volatility, scalability limitations, and lack of widespread merchant acceptance could pose obstacles for an AI system seeking stability and efficient transactions. Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could introduce uncertainties and risks for an autonomous AI system operating in this domain.

14. Immutable and transparent ledger: Bitcoin's blockchain provides an immutable and transparent ledger of all transactions. This means that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be easily altered or tampered with. This feature could be beneficial for an AI system as it can rely on the integrity and transparency of the transaction history without the need for trust in third-party intermediaries.
15. Network effect: Bitcoin has a well-established network effect, with a large user base, infrastructure, and community support. By adopting Bitcoin, an AI system could tap into this existing ecosystem, potentially facilitating faster integration, acceptance, and interaction with other participants in the network.
16. Ownership and control: Bitcoin allows for direct ownership and control of funds. An AI system could hold and manage its own Bitcoin wallet, enabling it to have full control over its assets without relying on intermediaries or third parties. This self-sovereignty aligns with the autonomous nature of an AI system.
17. Permissionless innovation: Bitcoin operates on an open protocol that allows anyone to build applications or services on top of it. This permissionless nature could empower an AI system to develop unique functionalities, services, or interactions within the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering innovation and experimentation.
18. Potential for interoperability: Bitcoin's adoption has led to the emergence of protocols and technologies aimed at enabling interoperability between different blockchains. By integrating with such interoperability solutions, an AI system adopting Bitcoin could potentially interact with other blockchain networks, expanding its capabilities and reach beyond the Bitcoin ecosystem. \> From \<[https://chat.openai.com/c/793fb088-0f06-4a74-875f-88b939fb31c5](https://chat.openai.com/c/793fb088-0f06-4a74-875f-88b939fb31c5)\>
