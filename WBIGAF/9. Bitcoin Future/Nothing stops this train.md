Let's see if I can summarize this off hand
 
- Governments forced to print, bitcoin stays 21 million, bitcoin price go up
- Debt based monetary systems are forced to expand, bitcoin stays 21 million, bitcoin price go up
- True metric is total global debt to total global liquidity
    - Liquidity being the money able to refinance that debt
    - In periods of excess liquidity risk appetite expands, and in periods of negative liquidity things break and the monetary base is expanded
- The only way out is through, aka growth or debasement
    - Growth comes only from government spending or trade surplus or wealth creation
    - Debasement comes from money printing
    - Productivity also comes with deflation
