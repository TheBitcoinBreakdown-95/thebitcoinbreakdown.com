- This is the new/digital gold rush, the ability to see its potential is what I've spent my whole life training and studying for

Bitcoin is gold for the 21st century and beyond  
It's money for a type 1 civilization

- I realized I like bitcoin and crypto in general because it’s all about taking freedom for ourselves, not waiting for permission or playing politics and playing fairly which is really just getting screwed over by those in power. It’s using technology to outsmart those in power, where a small number of individuals can overthrow the world order.

It may seem like libertarianism is losing in the world, authoritarianism/populism rising, but with the potential of a decentralized future, we'll just invent our way out of the legacy system and create a new one with freedom as the base layer. Imagine, decentralized statehood
   

The “HODL model hypothesis” is that bitcoin has crossed a historic inflection point where the asset’s illiquid supply is outpacing the rate of new supply issuance. Future halvings with lower supply issuance will only exacerbate this divergence
 
The tipping point is already here  
This is no longer a fringe asset class  
Bitcoin gets the most inflows of any crypto, all the fundamentals support it
 
Drawdowns have been less and less intense each cycle, and less and less of the overall supply is available for trading, Once the volatility smooths out, it's off to the races.
 - Owning bitcoins is one of the few asymmetric bets that people across the entire world can participate in. Much like a call option, an investor’s downside is limited to 1x, while their potential upside is still 100x or more. Bitcoin is the first truly global bubble whose size and scope is limited only by the desire of the world’s citizenry to protect their savings from the vagaries of government economic mismanagement. Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe — a catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve.

- Start small. Don’t put in more money than you are willing to lose.
- Stay humble. Don’t get greedy. Don’t over-extend yourself.
- Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Do not trust custodians. Always remember that trusted third parties are security holes.
- Don’t trust, verify. Assume that everyone is a scammer.
- Do your own research. Bitcoin is open by nature, so you are free to study what it is and how it works. I curate a comprehensive list of resources if you need a starting point.
    
It is early days now, but it is hard to overstate the eventual ==impact that Bitcoin will have== not just on the $10 trillion gold market but the $20 trillion art and collectible market, the $100 trillion stock market, the $225 trillion real estate market and the $250 trillion bond market over the coming decades.

We’re not here to get rich, we’re here to not get poor.

There really is only 14 mm bitcoin, the rest are lost forever

You can use treasuries, cash, gold or mortgages right now and BTC will also serve that role. The difference is this is one collateral the collateral holder knows can't be diluted away and has no counterparty risk. It's an actual asset rather than the commonly used debt products (mortgages, bonds) which are merely promises to pay, depend on subjective ratings agencies, and we know how that turned out in '08.
      

*****remember to look up Kathy woods projections on the different industries that bitcoin will steal market share from
      

After factoring in standard deduction, if you’re single & your sole source of income is long-term capital gains (the sale of investments held for at least a year), then the first $58,475 in profit you cash out on in a single year is subject to 0% federal income tax. If you’re married, this amount doubles to $116,950.  
If you’re planning to live off of BTC as your sole source of income in retirement it’s possible to live a fairly comfortable lifestyle with little to no income taxes paid at all.

A key way Bitcoin is different than equities: reflexivity.  
When a stock goes up, the multiple does up. At a certain point, people say, "this is over valued" and become less interested until the price goes down.  
Bitcoin is different.  
When Bitcoin's price goes up, people view it as more likely that it will succeed, and therefore be even more valuable. And so it's likely to go up even futher.  
A powerful dynamic.
