- Bitcoin will not be the "money" used for every transaction but it will become the foundation that money is layered upon

We're talking a new global financial and monetary system,  
Based on rules, not rulers
 - Bitcoin is the Manhattan project of the financial singularity
    - The world of finance will be remade with bitcoin at the core

#Bitcoin  is civilization-building, which takes a LONG time.
 
14 years into Bitcoin’s existence, we are still extraordinarily early in a project that will be extraordinarily difficult.
 
And by “civilization” what I really mean is the base layer of civilization, i.e. money. Bitcoin is the ongoing effort to reconstruct this base layer, which coordinates and directs human action, the cumulative results of which become societies and cultures.

It’s not just a way to move value through a communications medium. It’s an entire monetary manifesto. An affront to the fiat system.
         

The critique that the blockchain doesn't scale is nullified by the fact that different layers could always settle back to the main chain, and if we had a scheme where it was just a few large shared UTXO's then we could theoretically settle trillions and trillions in a single block. The network scales with value in a way that gold can't, even if the main chain does have a data cap/bidding structure in a way that gold doesn't.
