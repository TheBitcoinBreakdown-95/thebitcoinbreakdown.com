    - Imagine a point system on the internet that everyone used, and could freely traverse a variety of platforms and applications, providing a unified definition of value across them all.
    
    - If visions of the coming metaverse are true, then this kind of interoperability will be the fabric that weaves it all together. I believe that bitcoin has a key role to play in building a more unified commercial world — both on and off the internet — serving as a single, shared measure of value that can move across real and virtual borders with no friction.

"Bitcoin transfers value, not personal information  
Credit requires personal information being passed to conduct a transaction  
Bitcoin solves this by making the value digital and barer  
Eliminating fraud, data integrity and data security risks" - Jack Mallers  
Also enabling instant value transfer between robots, drones, ai, refrigerators cars boats etc.

Crypto anarchy  
[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-freedom-institutional-plan-world](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-freedom-institutional-plan-world)  
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name or legal identity of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols, with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.  
Keep this in mind: money does not need to be provided by governments. Rather, it is another example of a solution discovered by the interactions of free people (the market) that was monopolized by the government.  
Let the ruling classes tremble at a financial evolution. We are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.  
Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don’t much care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely-dispersed system can’t be shut down. The individuals have a world to win.
