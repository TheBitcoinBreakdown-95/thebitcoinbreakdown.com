Here is a little story of how I built a #Bitcoin  Lightning payments app used by more than 10,000 users at the time running on two Raspberry Pi's from my bedroom.
 
My conclusion: The banks are so fvcked ☠️

Some networks are “smart.” They offer sophisticated services that can be delivered to very simple end-user devices on the “edge” of the network. Other networks are “dumb” — they offer only a very basic service and require that the end-user devices are intelligent. What’s smart about dumb networks is that they push innovation to the edge, giving end-users control over the pace and direction of innovation. Simplicity at the center allows for complexity at the edge, which fosters the vast decentralization of services.
