- Forget everything you know about bitcoin. Forget everything you know about blockchain, and crypto,
- Once you begin this journey there's no going back
- Those who venture down this path rarely return
    - CEO's, politicians, millionaires, billionaires, presidents, academics, athletes, media personal, and money nerds alike have all fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole, and their stories are much like mine. Once you understand bitcoin in all its complexity your life and your view of the world will change forever,
    - Be warned, there are more questions than answers that lie ahead of you
- If you've ever watched the show Lost, you know what it's like to be sucked down a path of endless questions and an unquenchable thirst to know where it all leads.
    
- I wanted to make a good introduction to people,
- I know how revolutionary bitcoin is, but it's a really tough subject to explain.
- It took me a hundred hours to understand it, hundreds more just addressing my questions, and another few hundred after that trying to find the catch, and I want to break it all down so you can understand in 1/100th of the time
- And there's a lot of misinformation and scammy shit out there, and there needs to be more honest and dependable voices in the space
- And I want you to know, I was skeptical about bitcoin for many years, even after deeply understanding it.
    - It means you are a rational thinker and don't just blindly accept things as they are, which is an integral part of bitcoin, and a foundational value of all bitcoiners
    - We have a saying in bitcoin, don't trust, verify. I don't want you to trust what I'm telling you, I want you to be inspired to learn more and discover your own truth. 
I knew about bitcoin for a long time, but in hindsight I didn't know anything
 
Knowing about bitcoin, and realizing what bitcoin is, are two completely different things
 
In bitcoin circles we call this phenomena falling down the rabbit hole. It’s the process of slowly realizing what bitcoin is and then spending months and months and hundreds of hours obsessively learning as much as you can. My job is to make your fall down the rabbit hole as easy as possible,
 
if you're curious.
 
"even after a couple of years exploring what is bitcoin you’ll find that you are still learning you’re still trying to understand what it is. Part of the reason for that is because bitcoin is a really new technology it’s a really disruptive technology but it’s also an abstraction on a technology that is really old. That technology is money? - Andreas
 
- You're journey down the rabbit hole begins…with a simple question - What is bitcoin?
- It's a question everyone asks but no one seems to have a good answer for
    - John oliver host of last week tonight, said it best, bitcoin is everything you don't understand about computers combined with everything you don't understand about money
    -   
        
      
    
- Usually, the nerds will give you the technical definition, "Bitcoin is an open monetary transmission protocol"
- They'll tell you what it does and how it works, but I heard these jargon filled definitions repeated for years and they never helped me, in fact they all made bitcoin seem boring and underwhelming
- Because of all of these boring definitions, Bitcoin is very misunderstood, I can tell you it's not what you think it is
    -   
        
- It's a totally new invention, revolutionary invention, and yet it's shrouded in complex terminologies and elitist jargon
- the only things we have to explain what bitcoin is, are analogies of already existing technologies, but like the old saying goes, some analogies are helpful, but all are wrong
- Some of my personal favorite bitcoin analogies are:
    - Bitcoin is digital gold
    - Bitcoin is a swiss bank in your pocket
    - Bitcoin is the internet of money, a programmable monetary base layer internet protocol
    - Bitcoin is digital super gold, flying around the world at the speed of light in an unstoppable paypal
    - Bitcoin is the world's largest, most secure and most powerful supercomputer
    - Bitcoin is a digital organism, that pays humanity to keep it alive
    - Bitcoin is like beanie babies, except for ending human slavery
    - Bitcoin is a global anti-authoritarian political movement and peaceful technological revolution
    - Bitcoin is an escape hatch from our fiat capitalist, monopolistic, corrupt global monetary system
    - Bitcoin is magic internet tokens that you can put in an app, on a phone, silly little made up internet points that for some reason people pay tends of thousands of dollars for
      
    
- My personal favorite analogy for explaining bitcoin goes a little like this
    - Imagine there's this huge elephant, and a group of blind monks all walk up to it and start feeling it up to try and make sense of it.
    - Right so one monk is petting it's head, another is on its back feeling it's ridged spine, there's a monk clinging to one of its tusks, another is tossing around it's testicles, and yet another is rubbing on its toes.
    - The elephant of course is bitcoin in this analogy, there's so many different pieces, it's impossible for any one of us (the blind monks) to get a sense of it fully.
        - What makes it even more difficult to explain to new people is that there is no good elevator pitch for bitcoin, it truly depends on where you're coming from, your prerequisite knowledge, and personal values
        - explaining to the monk touching the elephant's tusks what the testicles feel like is totally a lost cause
    - My job of course is to lead you little monks all around the elephant, feeling all the parts to get a sense of something totally new. This of course requires a bit of commitment from the student, however I can promise you that you will find it very rewarding if you stick around.
    - Another thing I want to mention is that throughout this series the question of "What is bitcoin?" will come up in different contexts. There's not really a good way to answer that question in full in a single episode, but we'll cover the basics.
      
    
- What is bitcoin?
- Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, it is the invention of digital scarcity, it's a new form of money and an independent global monetary network, it was invented by a person or persons under the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto, and is a breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems
- In simple terms bitcoin is digital money. But then again so are dollars, euros, and yen. We have paypal, venmo, cash app, kohls cash, credit card reward points, heck you can even send money over Facebook messenger. So while digital money is technically correct, it doesn't really tell us anything
- What about digital gold? I'm sure you've heard that term tossed around, and honestly I do like it a lot better.
- If I was explaining bitcoin to a 5 year old I would say that bitcoin is just gold that's on the internet. In the same way that email is just internet mail, bitcoins are gold coins on the internet
    - I like this comparison because calling bitcoin digital gold tells you it's one of a kind, rare, and desirable.
    - Its an evolution of gold, where gold is great at moving value across time, its not great at moving value across space
    - Bitcoin is digital gold because it was specifically designed to fix all of the issues with gold including verifiability and divisibility
    - But still this definition is underwhelming., it is extremely simplified and doesn't really explain why it's revolutionary.
    - To steal another line from Andreas antanopolis, Saying bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone - What is bitcoin?
- Bitcoin is the next evolution in money, it’s a next generation monetary technology that is supplanting fiat currency
- Bitcoin is money for a type one civilization
- Bitcoin isn't an organization, it's a disorganization, a very powerful disorganization
- Bitcoin is the best savings technology in human history - What is bitcoin? Another analogy I like to us is "The great excel spreadsheet in the sky". Think of it like an ultimate google doc, a shared spreadsheet in the cloud which is just a list of transactions. That's literally all bitcoin is, it's just a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.
    - When we're talking about digital dollars or Zuckerburg bucks, the money ledger that record, is stored on a central server. Basically the bank has a private computer that they keep all the records of everyone's money. The big difference is that Bitcoin's ledger is a decentralized server. It's hosted on tens of thousands of computers across the globe. Every bitcoin computer has a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain, for a fully transparent system. Bitcoin's ledger is everywhere, its on the cloud, it's the great excel spreadsheet in the sky.
- Bitcoin is like an unstoppable paypal, beaming digital super-gold around the world at the speed of light
    - It allows you to send and receive value, to and from anyone in the world, with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection
    - The software operates on it's own, there's no customer service you can call, no corporation that can change the rules, and no government that can stop your payments.
- Bitcoin is just information, it's all just computer code, and cool math.
- It's gold that you can send from one phone to another or from one brain to another,
- “It’s a broadcast network where the message is the money. The network is a physical object comprised of computers which all together control the monetary policy and other rules, ensuring that the no single person or group can adjust them, like they can with fiat money.”_____
   
- Bitcoin isn't just money, it's isn't just a digital asset, it's also a network
    - It's an internet protocol, and a technology stack
    - it's not just a money, it's a global monetary system   

[617ac7fbe930f026261001d3_Bitcoin-101.pdf](file:///C:\Users\GC\AppData\Local\Temp\OneNote\16.0\Exported\%7B6A2DF0A4-D90C-4008-9944-84AB1A7C0161%7D\NT\0\617ac7fbe930f026261001d3_Bitcoin-101.pdf) - NYDIG  
Bitcoin is an open source monetary system - that is, a system for storing and transmitting an asset of value whose underlying code is fully open to the public. This system allows bitcoin (lowercase “b”), the native digital asset of the Bitcoin network, to be sent securely between users over the internet without the need of an intermediary. Transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain through a process called mining.
 
OK so what the fuck does that mean  
Bitcoin is an open source system, meaning all of bitcoin's code is available to inspect and it's in the public domain meaning you can freely copy and modify it. There's no copyright protections any all changes are visible to everyone. And it's voluntary meaning you don't even have to accept any changes or updates.  
Bitcoin is fully transparent for ethical reasons, but also so that it can replicate itself like a virus
 
Bitcoin is a monetary system, meaning that you can send, hold, and receive bitcoin within the software stack. Just like paypal or venmo, or a bank account. With bitcoin you can also program really cool transactions, timelock, multisig, batching, and program money into smart contracts. a level of programmability you can't do with normal money. Also with bitcoin, Robots, self-driving cars, drones, refrigerators, smart homes etc. can all hold and use bitcoin between themselves, a regulatory nightmare, and basically impossible with government money.
 
Bitcoin lowercase b is a native digital asset - meaning it's a token. Bitcoin spelled with a lower case b is usually referring to the money itself, like the dollar, and bitcoin with an uppercase B is referring to the network, like Paypal. It would be fucking weird if you paid people on paypal with a coin called paypalls, but in bitcoin the network and token have the same name which can be confusing.
 
bitcoin is sent between people over the internet without an intermediary, think of bitcoin on the bitcoin network like handing someone a physical gold coin or a dollar bill. When you pay in person for something there's no one in the middle of that transaction. All digital money before bitcoin had to go through some company or bank or government, someone you had to trust to get your money from point a to point b. Someone who took fees, or took 7-10 business days, or who declined your transaction, or who's website got hacked and your credit card information got stolen. Bitcoin removes all of that garbage from online banking. There's no one in between you and the person you're paying with bitcoin, the transmission is instead handled by autonomous computer code.
 
Transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain through a process called mining. So mining bitcoin is a bit complicated and not something I'll cover here, but basically what you have to know is that it is the process that sends and records transactions. When you send a transaction on paypal, the software just updates it's backend number spreadsheet. In bitcoin when you send a transaction it just updates it's backend number spreadsheet. Basically the same idea. Paypal's spreadsheet is private, and the company can theoretically go in and update whatever numbers they want. In bitcoin the spreadsheet is public, everyone has a record and no one has the ability to update any numbers.
         
- Bitcoin is the first system of money that is not controlled by any single entity, that is completely decentralized
    - No one can hack bitcoin, no one can change it's code, it runs completely on it's own
    - People can design around it, make wallets, trading platforms, lightning fast payment channels, and overall develop new complex financial infrastructure around this new money, but still the base layer money stays the same.
- Bitcoin can't ever be shut down, it updates it's ledger about every 10 minutes, and is designed to do this forever.
    - Bitcoin is the largest supercomputer on earth, in fact if every other supercomputer combined their computing power they still wouldn't be able to stop it
    - Bitcoin is like the entire United states military being used to fortify one small playground, somewhere deep in the rocky mountains.
    - It has a completely over the top security structure in order to keep itself alive, and keep the ledger from being corrupted.
- Bitcoin is a global network of tens of thousands of computers running the same free open source software
    - It is a peer-to-peer network, where every computer can communicate with any other computer directly, there's no central server processing all of the data, every computer is participating in the network
    - It's kind of like a big mushroom, there's not really a brain it's all just one big blob
    - Or you could even think of bitcoin as the brain itself, with electricity pulsing throughout the network to build one self-sufficient, autonomous, system.
- Each of these computers is keeping track of a ledger, basically a long list. They are keeping track of every bitcoin transaction ever made
    - When someone makes a bitcoin transaction every computer in the network (the nodes) updates their ledger, therefore bitcoin is on all of its computers at all times.    - Bitcoin is not just a money on the internet, bitcoin is the internet of money.
    - The internet is programmable information. It's unrestricted, global, instantly transferable information,
    - Bitcoin is programmable money, it's unrestricted, global, and instantly transferable money
    - The internet is a protocol that can be built upon. Bitcoin is a money that can be built upon.
    - The internet has allowed the coordination of humanity on a scale never before seen in human history, allowing for ideas and revolutions to spread like wildfire.
    - Bitcoin allows for unrestricted financing, it's pairing global coordination with unrestricted payments and fundraising.
        - With bitcoin, revolutions will never be the same            
   
- Bitcoin is a game, it's a lottery designed to financially incentivize humans to distribute its code and to protect its network.
    - Bitcoin is alchemy, people turn electricity into gold
    - “imagine leaving your TV on 24 hrs/day resulted in solved sudokus you could trade for heroine”
    - When people mine bitcoin they solve difficult mathematical puzzles in order to win the bitcoin lottery
    - However, these mathematical puzzles are actually designed to be like an annoying captcha and prevent scammers and bots from winning too much money. They keep the system honest and safe from bad actors
    - Bitcoin is game theory designed to hijack human greed to keep itself alive and uncorrupted
        - It’s a series of game theoretic feedback loops that imbed it further and further into society
        - It was designed with human nature in mind, to hijack our greed and increase it's price forever
        - Increases in price secure the network even more,
        - It will slowly absorb all of the wealth in the world,
      
    
- Bitcoin is a clock, it not only keeps track of time but bitcoin is a new kind of time, a time that is the same on tens of thousands of computers all at the same time,
    - The fancy words for this is that bitcoin is a distributed timestamp server that facilitates decentralized variable time in a trustless manner.
    - Basically think of each new block added to the blockchain as a tick or a tock, repeating for eternity
- Bitcoin is a justice arbitrator, like an automated court of law and executive system combined, it solves disputes in a peaceful nonviolent way, deciding what transactions came first, and what transactions are valid, through a process called Nakamoto consensus
    - This is a system that has justice built into it through math and truth
- Bitcoin is property rights codified. Rights that are written into code, code that can't be changed or erased. Property rights that are available for anyone in the world, even those without first world legal systems
- Bitcoin is an organism, some even would argue it's alive. It consumes, grows, reproduces, and lives autonomously.
- Bitcoin is a battery, storing energy across time and teleporting it across space
    - Money is a battery of labor energy, when you work 40 hours you're paid for your time, some people's time is worth more than others but still what you get in return for all of your hours working is a medium to store that energy for future productive use. You can spend all day fishing and get that exchanged for movie tickets. That's the power of money. Now imagine not only can you store your time and energy into a medium where it could be teleported all over the world without friction. The digital communities that can be built will not rely on physical location
- Bitcoin is an asset, a commodity, a money, a bank, a banking system, a monetary system and a global financial system.
- Bitcoin is a store of value, it's pure monetary premium, it's the best savings invention in human history
- it's digital property, the invention of a scarce digital asset

-   
     - Bitcoin is a bunch of numbers and code, there aren't even any coins, it's just a list of transactions and units.
- It is open source code that runs on its own, no country or company owns it, it was started by computer nerds and has reached a total network value of over a trillion dollars. No one is laughing at them anymore.
- it's a computer protocol and platform for sending messages. These messages are transactions of this new unit called Bitcoin. - Bitcoin is money, it's digital money, it's freedom money, ethical, moral, neutral, and fair money

It's sound money, it's powerful money, it's unstoppable money. It's money for the internet, and the internet of money

- Bitcoin is the first completely global, completely borderless, completely decentralized, completely open, form of money
    - One where you can build applications because it is programmable
    - One where you don't need permission to launch an application
    - Where there are no gate keepers or barriers to entry
    - Where ingenuity is financially incentivized, and an open market of ideas will flourish
    -   
        
     - What is bitcoin?
    - Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in Cryptography and Computer Science, and is the first accounting innovation in 700 years
    - It solved a decades old computer science problem enabling absolute, immutable scarcity. It's a highly-complex technological achievement and advancement for society: Bitcoin is the world's largest super-computer and is growing at a rapid clip, reinventing money as we know it.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto invented the world's first cryptocurrency— Bitcoin, on the principle that we can free ourselves from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and move money in a much more decentralized fashion
          
…
 
Bitcoin is a replacement for sovereign currencies
    
- You're going to hate this, but Bitcoin is actually two things, it's a currency and a network.
    - Bitcoin isn't just money, it's isn't just a digital asset, it's also a network
        - It's a payment tool, like visa, venmo, or paypal
        - It's an internet protocol, and a technology stack
        - it's a global monetary system and a global financial system
    - And actually it's three things, bitcoin is also the name of the software
 
Bitcoin is disruptive, and that is precisely why it is so difficult to swallow, to swaddle into traditional investment terms.  
Bitcoin is the first completely decentralized transnational platform for exchanging value, it has no borders, and doesn't care whether you like a transaction or not, it is entirely based on mathematical verifiability. It is the internet, unleashed, unvarnished, unpolished, and uncensorable. And if you can't swallow that pill, there's a startup out there that will embrace that innovation and disrupt your industry.
   
- ****Take the time here to introduce all of the bitcoin properties of later episodes
- The rest of this introduction series will explain how they invented a better money, why this platform of trust is truly revolutionary, and why bitcoin is truly one of a kind. - Then we'll cover the most important characteristics of bitcoin will in more detail throughout this audio series
    - Bitcoin is:
        - Decentralized, immutable, incorruptible
        - Is perfectly scarce, and perfectly elastic
        - Has an intervention free market
        - Is infinitely divisible
        - Transparent
        - Easily verifiable
        - Unforgeable
        - Unconfiscateable
        - Neutral and non-biased 3rd party
        - Resistant to censorship
        - Digitally portable
        - Permissionless
        - Has an unparalleled security infrastructure
        - And is extremely reliable
    - Bitcoin is the native money of the internet, but it's much more than that, it's the internet of money
    - Bitcoin solves many problems with our current fiat capitalist system, and is freedom money securing human liberty in the digital age
    - Bitcoin has a tumultuous past, and has emerged from it extremely strong and resilient
    - Bitcoin is the best savings technology ever invented, and will fix many of the ills in the world which stem from bad monetary policy and lack of institutional property rights
    - Bitcoin is programmable money, with so many use cases we haven't even thought of yet, due to its open source, permissionless nature, it will inspire innovation at the edges and the free marketplace of ideas will flourish innovation
    - Eventually bitcoin will not only be the money of the world, but the digital financial infrastructure all other money is layered upon
        - it's a whole new monetary and financial system that's based on the money being independent and uncontrollable
    - It is a true peer-to-peer money system, controlled by the people, for the people. 
    - Bitcoin is a credit default swap, a way to insure yourself against the failures of other currencies 
Still all of these definitions are a bit underwhelming
 
Bitcoin can be compared to so many things, but if you really dig into the third and fourth order effects, of this thing when it gets just a little bit bigger, it becomes obvious that bitcoin is equivalent to digital a monetary nuclear weapons, it's hardness as a monetary good, and it's absolute scarcity is the ultimate store of value tool, it obsoletes existing monies and monetary systems in a truly worrying way, this is an economic experiment that no one is really sure exactly how it's all going to turn out  
Bitcoin is the AI of money  
In the same way that artificial intelligence will have profound societal consequences in ways we can't predict, a self-sustaining monetary system has been dropped like a nuke into our digital economy,  
There's just so much that it is going to cause and reorganize in this world its truly insane
    - Really though, the best way I can describe Bitcoin is that it's a global project to create an independent money and monetary system
- Bitcoin is not the US dollar, Its not the pound, or Yen, it's an electronic money system designed outside of the existing financial system, and it runs on the internet. It's totally neutral.
- That may seem simple at first, but I can assure you this is extremely profound and revolutionary,
- Bitcoin is the real occupy wall street

 ==From== _The Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence_. The declaration includes a message of crypto-anarchism with the words: "Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian."

\> From \<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)\>   
 _The Economist_ describes bitcoin as "a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks".==[191]==

\> From \<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)\>   
Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science ~~cryptography~~, enabling absolute, immutable scarcity, the result of which, enables the freedom of humanity from the oppressive monetary exploitation of the state.

\> From \<[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vno0eg/describe_bitcoin_in_12_sentences_in_the_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/vno0eg/describe_bitcoin_in_12_sentences_in_the_most/)\>     

More than just a new monetary technology, Bitcoin is an entirely new economic paradigm: an uncompromisable base money protocol for a global, digital, non-state economy.

\> From \<[https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b](https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b)\>      
Bitcoin is the manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age  
Its a huge, research and development project to build a new global financial system,  
To build human rights protection software stack, not just an invincible money
 
To fight back against the encroachment of social engineering, financial repression, digital surveillance state
   

free from the manipulation of elites, corporations and authoritarian governments  
To give property rights, fair and neutral money, to 8 billion people   It's our only hope in freeing humanity from the digital prison of central bank digital currencies, savings debasement and debt slavery
 
What most people don't understand is that bitcoin is an ecosystem of projects, some of the smartest people I've ever heard of in my life, all working together, from everywhere on earth, to build truly unstoppable freedom technology without the permission of their governments
 
It's not about getting rich, it's about being free
 
You might not care about bitcoin and you might not need it yet  
But there are billions of humans on this planet who stand to benefit from bitcoin
 
So we'll continue to build, even if you don't like what we're doing.
 
Because bitcoin is truly unstoppable,  
So even if you don't believe us, even if you don't get it. It truly doesn't matter
 
bitcoin doesn't need you, but it'll be there be there when you need bitcoin

One is feeling the horns, one is feeling the tail, one is feeling it's balls, one is feeling it's tongue
 
There's no good way of describing bitcoin, it's so different than anything else that exists you can only explain it through analogies . And although analogies are useful for understanding, they are all technically wrong.
 
The great excel spreadsheet in the sky
 
Maybe I structure my talk as a what is bitcoin, and slowly bring up a bunch of interesting points, like one bullet point per slide, and just keep going, on and on
 
What is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a ledger, a distributed database of transactions, a list of who sent value to who. And it’s extremely secure. It’s the most secure computer and monetary network protocol in the world, and it is impossible to take down.  
Every 10 minutes that goes by bitcoin's heart beats, another block is added to the chain  
It gets more and more secure and more improbable to take down
 
Bitcoin is money, it's digital money, it's freedom money, ethical, moral, neutral, and fair money  
It's sound money, it's powerful money, it's unstoppable money. It's money for the internet, and the internet of money.
    
Bitcoin is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible. …PG 1. Mastering bitcoin.
   

- it's a lot more and a lot different than what you thought
- many of the people who get involved in Bitcoin describe this experience as going down the rabbit hole
- you get this instant effect where you feel that something special something amazing is happening
- and then you start reading about Bitcoin and then you get obsessed then you start reading more about Bitcoin and then you started showing your friends and family about it and you start talking about it at parties and dinner parties and your significant other goes oh god who we go again the Bitcoin talk, and then you get really obsessed and you've read about it for months and months and months and you don't eat enough and you get even more obsessed …
- that experience has happened to a lot of people in Bitcoin
- and the reason is the Bitcoin is not just a minor incremental change it's not a payments Network Bitcoin is one of the most fundamental transformations on the basis of money" -Andreas

There are many paths which might bring you close to Bitcoin’s gravitational pull: you might have an interest in cryptography, information security, or financial technologies. You may hold certain political or economic beliefs. You might be a gold bug, free speech advocate, or a speculator. You may need to use Bitcoin out of necessity  
Ask three strangers what Bitcoin is, and you will probably get three very different answers. Any answer is necessarily shaped by past experience, political and economic beliefs, and an individual understanding of the world. Your personal set of ideas, your world view, defines where you are on the landscape of ideas.  
The landscape has sets of ideas which clump together: narratives, which help to explain what Bitcoin is. One person might think of Bitcoin primarily as digital gold, focusing on the store of value aspect of Bitcoin. Another person might think of Bitcoin as a payment system, focusing on the medium of exchange aspect of Bitcoin. Yet another person might think of Bitcoin as a way to automate more complex social constructs, focusing on automation of contracts and similar idea  
These narratives, these sets of ideas, describe both what Bitcoin actually is — at least in part — and what people think it is. These narratives will necessarily evolve over time as our understanding of the system and the system itself evolves. Neither ideas, nor people, nor Bitcoin, nor the world at large are static things. Our visions of Bitcoin have changed, and will continue to do so in the future.

Bitcoin-everything you don't understand about money combined with everything you don't understand about computers - John Oliver
 
Page 77 the internet of money  
“Wow what a difficult task you have. At a very basic level you have to try to understand what is bitcoin. I can answer that question in for words. Bitcoin is digital money. But that doesn’t really capture it. It’s more like the Internet of money. But really it’s a consensus decentralized Network based on Blockchain technology and proof of work algorithm that allows a digital token to act as a reward system for a game theoretical competition between decentralize minors to validate……. and oh my it immediately goes off a cliff.  
even after a couple of years exploring what is bitcoin you’ll find that you are still learning you’re still trying to understand what it is. Part of the reason for that is because bitcoin is a really new technology it’s a really disruptive technology but it’s also an abstraction on a technology that is really old. That technology is money. Money is a tool it’s a technology. It actually shares commonalities with linguistic structures because we use it almost like a language to communicate value among ourselves in a society.

Bitcoin is not a physical or digital object. Rather, bitcoin (BTC) is a representation of value in the form of a record of ownership on the Bitcoin blockchain.
   

[Introduction to Bitcoin: what is bitcoin and why does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0)  
Forget everything you think you know about bitcoin  
Bitcoin has so many layers  
It isn't what it appears at first glance  
Blockchain isn't a system of currency  
It's a platform of trust  
Its not a company  
It's not a product  
It's not a service that you sign up for  
It's not just a currency, currency is just the first application
 
Bitcoin isn't an organization, it's a disorganization, a very powerful disorganization
 
It's not money for the internet, but the internet of money  
And what is money? Money is a language, a linguistic abstraction that we use to communicate value to each other
 
Bitcoin is the first system of money that is not controlled by any single entity, that is completely decentralized
 
[https://slate.com/technology/2022/07/christianity-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-baptism.html](https://slate.com/technology/2022/07/christianity-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-baptism.html)  
Tomer Strolight had never believed in God, but in 2013, he discovered Bitcoin.  
He was immediately fascinated. “The more I studied it, the more I realized that this is an incorruptible system,” he says, “that this is a system that has justice built into it through math and truth.”
   

Bitcoin is digital gold, but it's so much more than that, saying bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone
      

Bitcoin is the manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age (or the manhattan project for global human freedom)  
Like the manhattan project, bitcoin is an enormous globally coordinated research and development initiative, a race to develop an ultimate technology, a technology to establish permanent human freedom, and individual sovereignty on earth.
 
Bitcoin is property rights codified. Rights that are written into code, code that can't be changed or erased.
      

We are on the verge of a new transformation of money, of creating the first completely global, completely borderless, completely decentralized, completely open, form of money  
One where you can build applications because it is programmable  
One where you don't need permission to launch an application
    
Bitcoin is purpose built for one thing: value storage and settlement. It is the world's first and only perfected monetary settlement network, and it is actively scaling to serve the entire globe.
   

Bitcoin was the first currency to be both a payments solution and unit of currency at the same time. As such, the utility of the blockchain provided it value before it ever became a medium exchange, which was months after its launch, and thus actually confirmed Mises’s Regression Theorem in real life.

Bitcoin is a protocol which implements a highly available, public, permanent, and decentralized ledger. In order to add to the ledger, a user must prove they control an entry in the ledger. The protocol specifies that the entry indicates an amount of a token, bitcoin with a minuscule b - Google
       
Bitcoin is global digital money  
Bitcoin is digital gold  
Bitcoin is money for a type one civilization
 
Bitcoin is the entire United States armed forces guarding a 20 square foot child’s playground  
Bitcoin is the world's largest super computer  
It's computational network is so powerful, that every super computer on earth combined wouldn't be able to hack it or take it down
 
Bitcoin is a revolutionary asset class where value is represented not as a physical or digital object, but as a record of ownership on the Bitcoin blockchain.

"If you do get engaged in Bitcoin you'll quickly find out that mostly Bitcoin is none of the things you thought it was:
                - Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems.
- Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment—though as we discuss in subsequent sections, all these benefits face important limits.
- Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure— or even a requirement to provide a real name.
- Bitcoin’s design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history.
- Rather than store transactions on any single server or set of servers, Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power.
- Bitcoin’s rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators.
- Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency, including electronic payments. Since its inception in 2009 by an anonymous group of developers (Nakamoto 2008)

Bitcoin is a peer to peer network that anyone can participate in. It enables you to securely store value over time and to transfer that value to anyone else at any time without the need for a third party. It has a fixed and transparent inflation schedule that cannot be changed at will like ‘regular’ money. It is cash, for the internet.
   

[https://bitcoinnetwork.com/](https://bitcoinnetwork.com/)  
The bitcoin network is a global decentralized consensus network which operates on a cryptographic p2p protocol - on top of the Internet - established by individuals [computers / nodes] all around the world who run the **Bitcoin Core Software** [free open-source software] program which enforce Consensus Rules through an process called **Bitcoin Mining** which relay and validate UTXO transactions and record state to an immutable append-only Distributed Ledger; **Bitcoin Blockchain**. Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough in Computer Science, a highly-complex technological achievement and advancement for society: **Bitcoin is the world's largest super-computer and is growing at a rapid clip, reinventing money as we know it.**  
The **Bitcoin Network** enables **censorship resistant** digital value transfer and delivers **digital sound money** to the world for the first time in human history via its network-native and provably-scarce digital asset; **bitcoin** or **BTC**, often referred to as **the world's first *decentralized* digital currency**, cryptocurrency, or crypto asset. Bitcoin is a revolutionary yet peaceful non-political new monetary system for our digital-first global economy. Anchored by some of the most brilliant Computer Scientists, Software Engineers, and Entrepreneurs in the world, coupled with BILLIONS of U.S. DOLLARS in venture capital funding, this nascent technology infrastructure yet robust global eco-system has grown year-over-year for TWELVE CONSECUTIVE YEARS.  
Some people casually describe **Bitcoin** as money for the Internet, technology experts often refer to it as the 'Internet of Money', and a growing number of financial analysts, venture capitalists, and institutional investors are calling this phenomenon a next-generation **Digital Gold**. As the world begins to learn about and experiment with 'Programmable Money' and the public-facing top layers of the Bitcoin Network; **Bitcoin Wallets** and **Bitcoin Exchanges**, an exciting new $1 TRILLION U.S. Dollar **Bitcoin Asset Class** has emerged with a potential addressable market of double digit trillions.

Bitcoin is an open source monetary system - that is, a system for storing and transmitting an asset of value whose underlying code is fully open to the public. This system allows bitcoin (lowercase “b”), the native digital asset of the Bitcoin network, to be sent securely between users over the internet without the need of an intermediary. Transactions are verified and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain through a process called mining.

Retaining purchasing power is the goal. Increasing your purchasing power comes after retaining your purchasing power.

What that means is saying bitcoin is a currency is like saying the internet is email. Currency is just the first application. If you have a platform that allows you to record ownership and trust, the first type of asset you are likely to record on that ledger is obviously a currency. That's the most obvious application, but it's only the beginning. Bitcoin is not money for the internet, bitcoin is the internet of money, and currency is just the first app.  
- [x] Bitcoin is disruptive, and that is precisely why it is so difficult to swallow, to swaddle into traditional investment terms.  
Bitcoin is the first completely decentralized transnational platform for exchanging value, it has no borders, and doesn't care whether you like a transaction or not, it is entirely based on mathematical verifiability. It is the internet, unleashed, unvarnished, unpolished, and uncensorable. And if you can't swallow that pill, there's a startup out there that will embrace that innovation and disrupt your industry.
      

Bitcoin is a digital currency that aims to emerge as an alternative to FIAT across nations. And empower individuals with its decentralized nature and peer-to-peer technology for instant payments. Unlike the traditional financial system, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or organization, or by individuals. The price of Bitcoin solely depends on its demand and supply.  
Since its inception in the year 2008 by an anonymous creator or creators known to the world as Satoshi Nakamoto information  
. Bitcoin has taken the digital age by a storm, it also enjoys the title of being the oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s working relies on a completely decentralized system, making use of its open-source protocol. Which pushes it head-on against the flaws of FIAT.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto invented the world's first cryptocurrency— Bitcoin, on the principle that we can free ourselves from the regulation and control of banks and middlemen, and move money in a much more decentralized fashion  
Hold up— what does decentralized even mean? It's the opposite of the word "centralized", but what does that mean in the first place?  
Using regular money via the normal banking system requires going through different layers of regulation, from the bank itself, to perhaps a clearing house, maybe other middlemen, and even after passing through those layers your money may get frozen in place by the central government.  
This is a "centralized" system. One, or a few entities have overwhelming control of the entire system, and you do not have control over your money.  
Decentralized is just the opposite. Rather than a few entities having control over the system, many users help support the weight of the network. No single user can make a change without approval of other users, and the entire system works coherently and harmoniously.  
With Bitcoin (a decentralized system) and many other cryptocurrencies, you do have control over your money. Do you have to get approval from a bank to send Bitcoin? Can the government freeze your money? No.

**WHY IS BITCOIN REVOLUTIONARY?**  
[Bitcoin technology](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-makes-bitcoin-valuable) facilitates a trustless economic system where borderless financial transactions can be finalized without intermediaries. While traditional banking and payment systems heavily rely on trust, Bitcoin offers a way out of this system with no third party to resolve the double-spending problem and maintain properties like censorship resistance, immutability and decentralization.  
Such a framework allowed the creation and implementation of a system effectively disjoined from government control, delivering a revolutionary [separation of money and state](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-separation-of-money-and-state) for the first time in history. Bitcoin breaks all models we’re used to, starting with reduced state power and control, the exact reason governments and their affiliated mainstream media spread disinformation and FUD about Bitcoin.
 
Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system based on a distributed digital ledger called a [blockchain](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-blockchain) or timechain. The ledger includes transactions approved by the peer-to-peer network instead of a central authority. Bitcoin (with an uppercase letter B) refers to the protocol, software, and network, while bitcoin (with a lowercase b) describes the native monetary asset.

Bitcoin is just a set of rules  
It's a program that approves if transactions are valid  
That's all it does  
It is a computer program that keeps track of 2.1 quadrillion units, where they are currently, and what keys can unlock & move them  
You need the right keys to move these units in the network  
And these keys are just an un-fathomly large random number, that no one could guess  
Instead of locking these keys behind a computer program that could be hacked, they are locked by probability

What is bitcoin?*  
Craig Warmke  
Department of Philosophy, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL, USA  
ABSTRACT  
Many want to know what bitcoin is and how it works. But bitcoin is as complex as it is controversial, and relatively few have the technical background to understand it. In this paper, I offer an accessible on-ramp for understanding bitcoin in the form of a model. My model reveals both what bitcoin is and how it works. More specifically, it reveals that **bitcoin is a fictional substance in a massively coauthored story on a network that automates and distributes jobs normally entrusted to centralized publishing institutions.** My model therefore falsifies a popular view according to which each bitcoin is a chunk of code.
