To understand how bitcoin works under the hood, you can think of it like an ultimate google doc, a shared spreadsheet in the cloud which is just a list of transactions. That’s literally all bitcoin is, it’s just a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.  
At the most basic and fundamental level, bitcoin is just a ledger.  
But instead of existing on the computers of banks, it exists on hundreds of thousands of computers all around the globe.  
They all have the same ledger and everyone is in complete agreement with who sent money to who.   
If you’re having trouble putting an image of bitcoin in your head just think of a long digital excel spreadsheet, a calculator that keeps track of everyone’s money.

So when people say, bitcoin isn’t real, it’s the same as saying your money in the bank isn’t real.  
Except of course the bitcoin ledger is the most powerful and secure supercomputer on earth, can’t be hacked or shut down, and you have full autonomy over your savings.  
When we’re talking about digital dollars or Zuckerberg bucks, the money ledger is stored on a central server. Basically the bank has a private computer that they keep all the records of everyone’s money.  
The big difference is that Bitcoin’s ledger is a decentralized server. It’s hosted on tens of thousands of computers across the globe. Every bitcoin computer has a full copy of the bitcoin blockchain, for a fully transparent system. Bitcoin’s ledger is everywhere, its in the cloud.  
_It’s the great excel spreadsheet in the sky._

Bitcoin is like an unstoppable PayPal, beaming digital super-gold around the world at the speed of light. It allows you to send and receive value, to and from anyone in the world, with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection.  
The software operates on it’s own. All of bitcoins functions are facilitated by computer code. There’s no customer service you can call, no corporation that can change the rules, and no government that can stop your payments.  
And anyone can access it, no exceptions.
 \> From \<[https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-great-excel-spreadsheet-in-the-sky/](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-great-excel-spreadsheet-in-the-sky/)\>        

Bitcoin is revolutionary because it’s a trust machine. Bitcoin manufactures trust because there are no humans that run it or rule over it. Instead you are trusting in math, physics, code, and probabilities.
 
Bitcoin’s trust is based on a globally decentralized network of tens of thousands of computers that maintain the integrity of the system. Bitcoin is the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth by many magnitudes. Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, a record that can’t be changed or destroyed and is constantly being audited. Bitcoin is money which is held in the most secure vaults in human history, money which can’t be controlled or debased, and money which can’t be unfairly counterfeited to insiders.
 
It’s kind of like putting a calculator in charge of a global financial and monetary system. A calculator that can’t be hacked and whose code is fully transparent, leading to a fully trustworthy and fully rules based economic system.
 
Unlike today’s currency which is maintained by banks, corporations, and governments, bitcoin is open source software, a banking system that is instead run on top of the internet.
 
Bitcoin is truth because all transactions are made without trust. All disputes are solved through physics and all ownership is enforced by cryptography. This is an automated justice system programmed into software, software that’s incorruptible, secure, and eternal.
 
The entire point of bitcoin is to remove the distribution, production, and control over money from humanity. And the corruption that comes with it.
 
This is trust in math, trust in code, not in humans.
   

I think it’s helpful to picture bitcoin as “The great excel spreadsheet in the sky”. Think of it like the ultimate global google doc. It’s a shared spreadsheet in the cloud, freely accessible to anyone, and is just a long list of transactions. That’s literally all bitcoin is, it’s a ledger, a list of who sent money to who.
 
Ok that’s all well and good, but this great excel spreadsheet in the sky, why is that revolutionary?
 
Ok well let’s spice up the metaphor a bit – bitcoin is digital gold right? So instead of the excel sheet in the sky, think of it more like a golden tablet in the clouds, or on cyberspace mountain. This is some Moses shit. Carved into the enormous golden tablet is a list of all of the bitcoin in the world, who sent it to who and who owns it now.
 ![](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users\('giancarnevale@gmail.com'\)/onenote/resources/0-ec79f0d261a341d4b6955194cc3741e5!1-A8E1A7B825A2AD8D!537/$value)  

Once you send some bitcoin to someone, a new line is magically carved into the tablet and it stays there forever. Anyone can see this golden tablet, it’s open and transparent and visible to all, but no one can undo transactions once they’re carved. No one can actually touch this tablet and no one can change the rules. It exists beyond the clutches of humanity. We’ve created something we can’t stop.
 
This is the trust machine.
 
You can trust bitcoin because it’s secured by math and by code. You can trust the golden tablet because it’s not controlled by humans. You can trust the trust machine because it exists beyond trust.
 
Bitcoin is Physics in Cyberspace  
Because the network exists beyond humanity, bitcoin can be compared to the unchanging and automatic laws of physics. This is the law of the conservation of energy written into computer software. When you send bitcoin to someone, it’s like physically handing them a piece of gold.
 
There is no third-party involved when you hand gold to someone. Gold is an element from nature, literally a rock, and physics governs the rules to hand a rock to someone else.
 
Bitcoin is the gold in this analogy, but it’s also the physics. Bitcoin is the money and the network. It’s both the matter and the gravity. bitcoin is the gold and Bitcoin facilitates the transfer.
 
Except of course this is all existing in cyberspace, a borderless and permissionless global network. A programmable and unstoppable money transfer protocol. The world’s most powerful supercomputer beaming value at the speed of light to anyone, anywhere, any time.
 
Bitcoin is a Revolution  
Bitcoin was designed to be simple, have no loopholes, be incredibly secure, and do one job and do it better than anything else. It doesn’t have any bells or whistles and it doesn’t try to be anything that it’s not. Bitcoin is sound money, the best money humanity has ever had.
 
The purpose of bitcoin is to bring full sovereignty to the individual, and to remove all dependencies on trusted third parties. No rulers, no master, no hosts, only peers
 
GiGi  
Bitcoin removes humans from the control over money, it obsoletes the entire existing global monetary framework, it replaces a system of money that is manipulated, debased, and untrustworthy, to one that you can trust. A system where the rules can’t be changed to benefit the rich and powerful. A system where no matter how much bitcoin you have, you can’t alter the tablet. THAT is monetary revolution.

- What is a ledger?
    - When you send a transaction on paypal, the software just updates it's backend number spreadsheet. In bitcoin when you send a transaction it just updates it's backend number spreadsheet. Basically the same idea. Paypal's spreadsheet is private, and the company can theoretically go in and update whatever numbers they want. In bitcoin the spreadsheet is public, everyone has a record and no one has the ability to update any numbers.
- What is proof of work?
    - Proof of work is like a captcha puzzle, that makes you do a little task to confirm you aren't a bot, proof of work is like that, it requires your computer to solve puzzles that ensure you are playing the game fairly
    - The proof of work algorithm is like a test you would take in high school
        - It's a total waste of time and energy, but it proves you know the material
        - It is the credibility that you put in the work to learn
        - In bitcoin the hashing function of nonces is technically completely useless, except that it proves miners are spending time and energy protecting the network. It's cryptographic proof that the system is being secured, and that transactions are valid. Bitcoin is credible because of this guarantee, in the same way
      
    
- What does decentralized mean?
    - [Blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-bitcoin/) is decentralized, which means it’s not controlled by any one organization. “It’s like a Google Doc that anyone can work on,” says Buchi Okoro, CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax. “Nobody owns it, but anyone who has a link can contribute to it. And as different people update it, your copy also gets updated.”
    - Decentralized timestamp server
        - Ok picture this, you have this machine at Amazon that puts marbles in little boxes 📦 and as the boxes go down the conveyer belt one mechanical arm puts the marbles inside and then the next closes the boxes and the next tapes them shut, and then the last arm slaps a label on the box and then they are loaded onto a truck and sent out
                                                        \> From \<[https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-great-excel-spreadsheet-in-the-sky/](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/the-great-excel-spreadsheet-in-the-sky/)\>     

In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distrib­uted timestamp server to generate compu­ta­tional proof of the chrono­log­ical order of trans­ac­tions. -Satoshi Nakamoto (2009)
 
Bitcoin solves this problem by re-inventing time itself. It says no to seconds and yes to blocks.
 
This problem is precisely why all previous attempts of digital cash required a central­ized registry. You always had to trust someone to correctly identify the order of things. A central­ized party was required to keep the time.
 
A time-related tool [is] needed to estab­lish a canon­ical ordering and to enforce a unique history in the absence of any central coordi­nator. -Giacomo Zucco, Discov­ering Bitcoin (2019)
      
110. Mining/Mining nodes have 6 main Functions:
    1. Permanently record transactions on the blockchain (or timechain)
        1. Pulls verified transactions from the mempool and puts them into blocks
        2. Hashing nonces, finding solutions to the proof of work, and broadcasting blocks
        3. This is makes bitcoin a decentralized timestamp server, aka a clock - mining permanently records the order of transactions, and establishes a flow of time. Instead of seconds, it's blocks
    2. Establishing Nakamoto consensus
        1. Bitcoin uses a Proof of work consensus mechanism to achieve consensus,
            1. **Nakamoto Consensus**: This consensus mechanism ensures that all participants agree on the state of the blockchain. The longest chain, with the most cumulative proof of work, is considered the valid chain. This decentralized approach to consensus means that no central authority dictates the state of the ledger.
        2. Peaceful conflict resolution
            1. **Resolving Conflicts**: When two blocks are mined simultaneously, miners build on the block they received first. The chain that accumulates the most proof of work (the longest chain) becomes the accepted chain. This method resolves conflicts in a decentralized manner without needing a central arbiter.
        3. Solving the byzantine general's problem
        4. The longest chain, with the most work put into it, is the correct order of transactions. There's no room for disagreement. Conflicts in the order of time are solved through mining, and not through force, ensuring peaceful conflict resolution.
    3. Securing the network
        1. Hash rate force field
        2. In order to change the flow of time, you need to sustain a majority of the hashing power, the more hashing the higher the forcefield protecting the legitimacy of the network
        3. "Preventing double-spending attacks by ensuring the integrity and chronological order of transactions."
        4. Decentralized Network Control: Mining ensures that no single entity or small group can control the Bitcoin network, promoting a truly decentralized system.
        5. Trustless Verification: By relying on a decentralized network of miners, Bitcoin minimizes the need for trust in any central authority or intermediary.
        6. Censorship Resistance: A decentralized mining network helps protect against censorship and ensures that transactions are processed without interference from any central party.
        7. Economic Security: The distributed nature of mining provides economic security to the network, as it becomes prohibitively expensive for any single actor to attack or manipulate the blockchain.
        8. Geographic Distribution: Mining operations spread across different geographical locations reduce the risk of regional disruptions impacting the entire network. ![](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users\('giancarnevale@gmail.com'\)/onenote/resources/0-6519289cce8648dcbae7b2b7961196fc!1-A8E1A7B825A2AD8D!537/$value)
