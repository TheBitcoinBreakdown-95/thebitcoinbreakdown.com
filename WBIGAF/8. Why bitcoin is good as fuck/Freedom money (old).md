***I need more research on the founding fathers, and monetary freedoms  
I want this piece to be the most GC american shit EVER  
This is the most important piece and what I'm most passionate about  
Cypherpunks, CBDC's, dystopian futures  
Bitcoin isn't an investment, it's not about getting rich, it's about being free  
*The good thing is while people talk about freedom money, there are so many other things this gets lost in the sauce, and I can be the person who preaches about it and sends chills down people's spines
   

Always start with the problem!!
    
- Without monetary/financial freedom all other rights are at stake.
    - This is probably one of the main insights I had which led me to devote my life to bitcoin
- The classic example is China, where social credit score and CBDC leads to financial control over their people on a scale never before possible by despotic governments
    - It's a science fiction nightmare coming to life before our eyes
- Starting off with the freedom of speech, the power to shut off the access to save or spend your money could be used against enemies of the state. Protesters to authoritarian regimes could be silenced not just by deleting their platform access, but by turning off their livelihood.
- Their movement could be limited they wouldn't be able to pay for gas, a car service, a train ticket or get on a plane
- Their family and associates could also be targeted
- As a more extreme example, by shutting off someone's money to buy food or pay rent, you can own their life.
- By censoring what people can buy, other rights could be selectively targeted
- Prohibiting donations to an enemy religion
- Prohibiting the purchase of certain "revealing" clothing
- Or probably most importantly for defending rights, purchase of weaponry could be censored by the citizenry
- You may think these things would be highly unconstitutional, and that they could never happen to us. Except for the fact that history is full of these scenarios, and billions of people not in western democracies are at risk. This would also be ignoring the canadian trucker

Bitcoin is the manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age  
Like the manhattan project, bitcoin is an enormous research and development undertaking, a race to develop an ultimate technology, a technology to establish permanent human freedom, and individual sovereignty on earth.
 
Bitcoin is property rights codified. Rights that are written into code, code that can't be changed or erased.
   

Ludwig von Mises argues that sound money is an instrument for the protection of civil liberties and a means of limiting government power (1912) Found in The Theory of Money and Credit
   

But Bitcoin is not just “number go up” technology. Hidden behind the eye-popping gains is a powerful “freedom go up” technology that its new adopters are, knowingly or not, pushing forward. NGU and FGU are inextricable.
 
Bitcoin’s decentralized digital cash did not emerge from Y Combinator, but rather was the holy grail of the cypherpunks, a group of civil liberties advocates concerned about how personal freedoms could survive the great electronic transformation of society. Their goals were to separate money from governments and corporations, check the growth of the global surveillance state, and preserve human rights in an increasingly digital age. Satoshi Nakamoto’s greatest trick was to animate these aspirations into something that looks like and functions as digital gold.  
So, while, yes, Bitcoin gives anyone — regardless of their nationality, status, wealth, gender, race or beliefs — access to the best savings technology on the planet, it _also_ gives them unstoppable, programmable money that cannot be debased or censored and that fights surveillance and confiscation. Dissidents, democracy protestors, opposition leaders and independent journalists worldwide are beginning to realize this, from ==Minsk to Lagos== to Los Angeles to Buenos Aires.  
…  
With Bitcoin, self-interest and freedom are aligned. Even if one has zero altruism, as one buys or mines bitcoin, they drive up the network’s security model and make a more robust freedom tool for everyone else. Refreshingly, Bitcoin does not care about one’s intentions. It enables greater liberty and empowerment not by some ambitious humanitarianism but by each participant’s honest self-preservation.  
And this dynamic continues to expand. For instance, bitcoin exchanges today are not adopting the Lightning Network for privacy reasons — they are adopting it to reduce fees — but they are spreading the freedom tech anyway as they popularize a way to transact off-chain on an onion-routed second layer.  
On the horizon, a Bitcoin upgrade called Cross Input Signature Aggregation (or [SigAgg](https://jimmysong.substack.com/p/the-future-of-bitcoin-privacy-cross) for short) could incentivize exchanges to engage in collaborative spends which would fluster the surveillance state. Again, corporations will not push this privacy improvement for moral reasons but to improve their bottom line. This is Bitcoin’s game theory: transforming greed into freedom.

**"It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights."**…"Friends and foes of liberalism considered it one of the essential postulates of a liberal policy."  
The excellence of the gold standard is to be seen in the fact that it renders the determination of the monetary unit's purchasing power independent of the policies of governments and political parties. Furthermore, it prevents rulers from eluding the financial and budgetary prerogatives of the representative assemblies. **Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money. Viewed in this light, the gold standard appears as an indispensable implement of the body of constitutional guarantees that make the system of representative government function.**
