[Jordan Peterson's Mind Blown By Bitcoin Mining & Energy | Orange Pilled By Saifedean | 11/15/2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am7L648-ML0)  
The video titled "Jordan Peterson's Mind Blown By Bitcoin Mining & Energy | Orange Pilled By Saifedean | 11/15/2021" on the BITCOIN YouTube channel features a discussion about Bitcoin mining and its impact on the global energy market. Here are the key insights from the video:
 
Bitcoin Mining and Energy Efficiency: The video discusses how Bitcoin mining can be profitable for those who can secure electricity at less than five cents per kilowatt-hour. This rate is lower than most places in the world, making Bitcoin mining an attractive option for those with access to cheap energy.
 
Impact on Global Energy Market: Bitcoin mining is highlighted as a unique way to monetize energy that is location-independent. This aspect is particularly beneficial for areas with abundant energy but high costs to transport it to population centers. The discussion points out that Bitcoin mining allows for the monetization of energy without the need for extensive infrastructure like wires, pipelines, or tankers.
 
Bitcoin as a Resource Mover: The video suggests that Bitcoin is an effective means of transferring resources from places with cheap electricity production to other areas where electricity is more expensive. This process potentially increases the value of cheap electricity.
 
Potential Deflationary Impact on Electricity Costs: There's a suggestion that Bitcoin could have a deflationary effect on electricity costs worldwide. By providing a global subsidy for cheap electricity production, Bitcoin could counteract the effects of fiat subsidies that have led to unreliable energy grids.
 
Investment Opportunities: The discussion also touches on the investment potential in Bitcoin. It is suggested that investing in Bitcoin mining in areas with cheap, geographically isolated energy production is not only profitable but also likely to increase in value over time, assuming the continual rise in Bitcoin's value.
 
Contradiction to Bitcoin's Energy Criticism: The video concludes with a point that contradicts the common criticism of Bitcoin as a waste of the world's resources. Instead, it is presented as a beneficial tool for monetizing isolated energy production, which could be revolutionary in how energy is valued and traded.
 
Overall, the video presents a perspective on Bitcoin mining as not just a financial activity but also a significant player in the global energy market, with potential far-reaching implications for how energy is produced, valued, and utilized.
