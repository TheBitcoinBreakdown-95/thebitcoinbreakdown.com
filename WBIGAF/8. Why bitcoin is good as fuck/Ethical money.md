Slavery is 40MM people today, compared to 12MM displaced people during the Atlantic slave trade  
Forced labor, conditions are worse because people are cheaper and replaceable  
Most of that is due to extreme poverty.  
Poverty also causes increased violence, etc.  
What causes poverty? Why are so many nations poor?  
Bitcoin provides private property rights, and platforms to escape corrupt financial systems of poor nations, escape debt slavery and escape inflation.

Bitcoin and Bitcoiners are here to change that, not by replacing one group of arbitrary rulers with another, but by removing rulers altogether and replacing them with a set of verifiable, incorruptible rules that nobody can take advantage of at the expense of someone else.

- Who needs bitcoin?
    - "Ask a Venezuelan if they need bitcoin; the answer is yes. Someone from Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine, Greece, Cyprus…they need it. People who live under despotic governments and dictatorships, people who are fighting revolutions, people who are dealing with currency controls and corrupt banks, people who can't trade internationally. People who do not have sufficient documentation to open a bank account, people trying to transmit money to their relatives across boarders in conflict areas…they need it. They need something that is free, open, borderless, and censorship-resistant. They need that for smart contracts, privacy and currency itself." - Andreas The Internet of Money vol. 3

The critics will say, sure, I'll hand it to you, bitcoin is the 'internet of money' a revolutionary innovation in economics, fintech, cryptographic systems, distributed computing, and information theory.
 
Sure, it's some cool programmable and public internet based monetary infrastructure which can transform society. Altering the way humans and artificial intelligence systems will interact and coordinate within the global economy. Sure it's the best money ever invented and is completely unique, vastly improving on the monetary properties of gold and our broken fiat capitalist monetary system. And sure, whatever, I'll even hand it to you that maybe the global economy will be built on top of bitcoin someday.
 
BUT bitcoin is still money, and money is the root of all evil. Bitcoin is inherently capitalist and spreads all of the perverse incentives money has always embodied throughout history. There's nothing ethical about money and therefore, from a morality standpoint bitcoin is still evil.
 
What money haters get wrong is that bitcoin actually has the moral high ground in so many ways, and fixes a lot of the monetary evils that exist in our world. Sure humans will always want to get value for as little work as possible, which is why all systems prior to bitcoin were corrupted. Bitcoin flips the incentives and creates a system where money can't be unfairly distributed to insiders, where people play fairly by the rules, because playing fairly is what makes you the most money.
 
Since money is vital for resource coordination in social groups larger than a few dozen people, our globally connected internet society can't exist without some sort of medium of exchange. So if money is vital for society, shouldn't the money chosen be the most ethical possible?
 
That's where bitcoin comes in. Not only is bitcoin the best money and monetary system ever invented, but it's also the most ethical.
