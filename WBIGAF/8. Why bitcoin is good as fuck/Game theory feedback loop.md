- It’s a series of game theoretic feedback loops that imbed it further and further into society

It was designed with human nature in mind, to hijack our greed and increase it's price forever  
Increases in price secure the network even more,  
It will slowly absorb all of the wealth in the world,

- Usually when an asset goes up in price, people make more of it, which then makes the price go down.

The game theory behind bitcoin is that, bitcoins are doled out on a fixed schedule, like a lottery. Miners are actually just competing in a big game to win the next bitcoin. So instead, when the price of bitcoin goes up, people try to mine it, but they can't make more of it, so the price stays up.  
And not only does the process of mining make more bitcoins, but also the actual mining 'work' you do to play in the game, confirms transactions and secures the network. It’s a positive feedback loop that further makes the protocol more secure and valuable, thereby raising the price, and the process starts over.

- Another thing I thought of, if I'm going to be dismissing bitcoin being banned here, is that the reason bitcoin has been operating under the shadows and no one really cares or is paying attention to it is because everyone has a low time preference, every politician cares way more about their term in office and issues facing them today, they could care less if bitcoin actually succeeds and establishes permissionless and unstoppable individual sovereignty

    - Cryptocurrencies are a volatile investment today, but card companies including Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are betting crypto will one day be used routinely for everyday purchases from food to clothes to plane tickets—and they don’t want to be left behind when that happens.
- I came for the "getting rich" but I stayed for the "global monetary disruption"
    - Bitcoin uses financial incentives to gain notice and adoption, even thought it's a decentralized system with no founder or marketing team
 
- The more hodlers the more rich they all get, the more powerful they get, the more people with a vested interest in keeping the system alive. Security increases not just in the miner sphere but also in the social and regulatory sphere as people get richer.
- Lindy affect/time (the longer bitcoin survives the more likely it is to not go away) + the market cap/liquidity increase means more HNW will adopt (since it's less volitile and less risky) which increases it's legitimacy and liquidly and performance which brings in more money    

there’s also the game theory of mining decentralization, where, similar to James Madison‘s writings in federalist 10 regarding majority faction, The best way to prevent majority rule, or mining centralization, is to have mining, geographically dispersed, across the whole world, which will prevent any single majority from being able to censor or disrupt the “common good” which is bitcoin’s ability to function

Bitcoin has been called a “vortex of incentives”. But what does that mean? Let’s unpack that. 👇
 
Bitcoin works without an active founder, without a CEO or leadership team (or any team at all), without a headquarters, and without a marketing budget. Yet the network continues to survive and thrive.
 
Let’s examine how that works.
 
A 🧵
 
As brilliantly as Satoshi designed the protocol itself, he also demonstrated next level genius by engineering the incentives to make sure the network would thrive all on its own.
 
Bitcoin needs four things to stay alive and to thrive:
 
1Miners to keep the ledger secure and immutable  
2Nodes to keep the network decentralized  
3Developers to add capabilities to the protocol  
4Buyers to increase the network effect, propel the price upward, and reinforce the aforementioned incentives in a virtuous cycle.  
Security - How Bitcoin leverages human incentives secure itself.
 
Not only is bitcoin secure. It’s the most secure computer network in the history of the world.
 
Miners must invest their own money to build energy infrastructure and equipment to turn energy into hashes. The more hashes one contributes, the more BTC they earn from block rewards today, and from fees tomorrow.
 
The block reward was a brilliant way to incentivize people to make this investment in the early days, (before Bitcoin has a massive network effect) in expectation of an outsized return. The incentive works so well that despite the price being more than 60% off it’s all time high and despite the fact that fees don’t pay enough to cover miners costs at the time of this posting, the network hashrate has exploded from 160 EH at the time of the ATH to 400 EH today. This indicates that there’s a global hash war happening as people race to get their hands on the last 2 million coins.
 
As miners pursue their own selfish interests, everyone else in the network benefits from additional network security well before the network can remain secure from fees alone.
 
Nodes - How bitcoin leverages human incentives to keep itself decentralized.
 
For the first time in history we have a form of decentralized open-source money that we can truly keep beyond the reach of governments and central banks. Bitcoin is money of, for, and by the people. That gives people a strong incentive to contribute to the network by running their own node. Not only does running a node give people a say in how the protocol is developed and empower plebs to act as guardians over the protocol rules, it is also a better way to verify transactions and to enhance privacy over one’s own Bitcoin transactions. The more people who run nodes, the more decentralized Bitcoin becomes as a whole. The more decentralized Bitcoin is, the more impervious it is to being attacked or co-opted.  
How Bitcoin incentivizes the development of protocol enhancements and layer 2 and layer 3 solutions.
 
By focusing on security and decentralization on layer 1, the core protocol remains simple and robust. Bitcoin does what it was designed to do; act as the best store or value in history. The decision to prioritize security and decentralization meant that scaling would have to happen on higher layers.
 
By restricting block size and and the scalability of layer 1, builders gain confidence that bitcoin is going to imbue the same key SoV properties in 20 years that it has today.
 
That’s the kind of stable foundation that gives entrepreneurs the confidence to raise capital and build protocols and/or companies on top of #Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s layer 1 constraints represent opportunities for entrepreneurs to add value on higher layers without sacrificing the security or decentralization of the base layer.
 
We can see this happening with Lightning which solves what Bitcoin cannot solve on the base layer (scalability), and with layer 3 solutions like Fedimint that sit on top of Lightning and adds capabilities that Lightning cannot easily solve, like a simplified non-custodial experience.
 
Both Lightning and Fedimint will give rise to numerous companies that leverage the capabilities of these protocols to solve specific needs for customers.
 
All of these capabilities will come to Bitcoin without costing Bitcoin any money. No need for a foundation or active founder to manage an endless roadmap of layer 1 priorities.  
Buyers - How Bitcoin creates a strong network effect all on its own.
 
Bitcoin solves a real world problem for nearly everyone on earth. Buyers are plebs, elites, institutions and nation states who all have a strong incentive to increase their purchasing power. Bitcoin has proven itself to be the fastest horse in the race against inflation. The more it performs, the more people it sucks in via FOMO which propels the price of #BTC the asset even further and strengthens its network effect.
 
Strong price action and an increasing network effect creates a positive feedback loop because the higher price gives miners a growing incentive to invest more into securing the network, gives more people an incentive to run a node, and gives more companies an incentive to start building products and protocols on top of Bitcoin.  
Satoshi understood human nature and brilliantly designed bitcoin to be resistant to every possible attack vector while also ensuring that Bitcoin not only survives, but thrives.
 
Everything that Bitcoin needs to continue living is provided by human beings acting out of their own self interest. But unlike the tradi-fi system, where perverse incentives lead to disproportionate outcomes (rich getting richer at the expense of everyone else), Satoshi designed the incentives such that people pursuing their own selfish interests actually benefits everyone else on the network.

Releasing his software into the wild set in motion a multi-decade process that is driven by an extremely powerful incentive structure. An unstoppable idea, embodied in code. It is this incentive structure that drives Bitcoin’s survival. And with every passing day that Bitcoin refuses to die, humanity is one step closer to freeing money from the capture of the state. It will take some time for the world to come to grips with this most powerful idea.

The market cap is complete BS and has nothing to do with the demand or the size of the network.  
The price is determined by the marginal seller, which is impacted by supply and demand. So demand being held equal, the supply will continue to decline signaling an improvement in price. Supply is of course hard coded into the bitcoin protocol, via the difficulty adjustment and halving events, but liquid supply is also impacted by those willing to sell. If bitcoin is indeed held as a store of value, and more and more is taken off of exchanges never to be sold, the supply crunch will be more intense than the predictable stock to flow. Bitcoin is unique in that the supply is extremely limited already and there's a culture/religion around never selling. The supply is also impacted by coins that are burned, and the coins that are staked into other crypto markets and exchanges. **The number of bitcoin being used as loan collateral, option futures, and locked up in smart contracts will continue to increase as the price appreciates as well. The faster the price appreciation the less supply will be available since gains are accelerating, and short term investors have a greater opportunity cost to sell.** Another factor could be traditional investment vehicles, like ETF's or other funds which are correlated 1 to 1 with bitcoin and therefore more bitcoin needs to be locked into funds making it inaccessible to exchanges. And yet another factor to the supply crunch is international adoption as a store of value and inflation hedge. There are hundreds of millions of people who theoretically would be prime adopters to such an asset as their local currency and investment options are limited and far inferior to bitcoin.  
The big question is of course how to measure demand, since the supply is more predictable. A lot of supply determinates also impact demand. And the true question is whether or not demand will continue to increase. The S curve adoption of bitcoin, the number of active addresses, and other demand valuation models can be used to predict the demand, but overall there's no way to know how it's all going to shape out. Theoretically and historically bitcoin has proven itself to be the perfect asset, however there's no telling how the international regulatory framework will impact this demand. If bitcoin gets too popular, on ramps and off ramps into local currency could be regulated to death and severely impact trading volume. I don't want to speculate on price following such an event because there would be too many factors to accommodate for. However, if exchanges to fiat could be completely decentralized/anonymous and impossible to regulate, (which is the direction the technology is headed) then there would always be a way to transact without permission. Another hindrance to demand is ESG policies limiting institutional adoption due to the energy intensive process of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is getting more and more green, but more importantly the supply of bitcoin originating from mining will continue to decline as time goes on. It can be argued that the ecosystem being secured by mining though will be a black eye to bitcoins reputation, but how much this will impact institutional adoption is hard to say for sure. The price appreciation might be too much to ignore, and the security will be too great an assurance.  
All this considered, it's most likely that the continued price appreciation leads to a greater and greater demand, and the 'number go up' drug is too good to ignore. ESG rules regulating big money adoption will all be sorted out in the coming years and loopholes (like stock in bitcoin companies etc.) will be exploited to get on the bandwagon. I think all price prediction models are conservative and this thing is gonna pop the fuck off.
       
In this sense, Bitcoin’s terminal money supply growth (inflation) rate of absolute zero is the ultimate monetary ==Schelling point== — a game-theoretic focal point that people tend to choose in an adversarial game. In game theory, a game is any situation where there can be winners or losers, a strategy is a decision-making process, and a Schelling point is the default strategy for games in which the players cannot fully trust one another (like money):
