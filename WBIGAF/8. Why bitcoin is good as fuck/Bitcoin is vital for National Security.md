- Global, organic demand for Bitcoin and USD-based stablecoins may help counter China’s geopolitical ambitions for the digital yuan and the Belt and Road Initiative.
- If Bitcoin were to monetize to reach close parity with gold, the U.S. (holding the most Bitcoin) would gain relative to our adversaries, and may serve as an asymmetric hedge against tail risks in the Treasury market.
- A gradual shift to a global monetary system centered on a neutral reserve asset that we hold a large share of would allow the U.S. to reverse the structural trade flows which have eroded our manufacturing capacity and made us acutely vulnerable to Chinese supply chains.
- As the foundation for an emerging “internet of value” Bitcoin (and “second layers” like the Lightning Network) may drive domestic innovation and transform our digital economy.

- Bitcoin mining (which the U.S. leads) may generate positive externalities for our energy system, as a buyer of first and last resort for renewables and as a flexible load grid resource.

The dollar-based monetary order is already being challenged in multiple ways, but two in particular stand out: the spread of de-dollarisation efforts and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). De-dollarisation is not a new theme. It started with the launch of quantitative easing in the wake of the financial crisis, as current account surplus countries frowned at the idea of negative real returns on their savings. But recently, the pace of de-dollarisation appears to have picked up. Over the past year, China and India have been paying for Russian commodities in renminbi, rupees and UAE dirhams. India has launched a rupee settlement mechanism for its international transaction while China asked GCC countries to make full use of the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange for the renminbi settlement of oil and gas trades over the next three to five years. With the expansion of Brics to beyond Brazil, Russia, India and China, the de-dollarisation of trade flows may proliferate
   

The emerging, CBDC-based network — enforced with bilateral currency swap lines — could enable central banks in the global east and south to serve as foreign exchange dealers to intermediate currency flows between local banking systems, all without referencing the dollar or touching the western banking system.
   

Change is already afoot. The current account surpluses of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are at a record. Yet these surpluses are largely not being recycled into traditional reserve assets like Treasuries, which offer negative real returns at current inflation rates. Instead we have seen more demand for gold (see China’s recent purchases), commodities (see Saudi Arabia’s planned investments in mining interests) and geopolitical investments such as funding the BRI and helping allies and neighbours in need, like Turkey, Egypt or Pakistan. Leftover surpluses are held increasingly in bank deposits in liquid form to retain much-needed options in a changing world. In finance, everything is about marginal flows. These matter the most for the largest marginal borrower — the US Treasury. If less trade is invoiced in US dollars and there is a dwindling recycling of dollar surpluses into traditional reserve assets such as Treasuries, the “exorbitant privilege” that the dollar holds as the international reserve currency could be under assault.
