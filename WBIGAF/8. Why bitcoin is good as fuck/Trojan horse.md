- Bitcoin harnesses the wealth and greed of first world countries and uses it to secure a freedom system for the rest of the world
- Bitcoin is a trojan horse for freedom, it's monetary properties are too enticing (and it's technology has spun off into so many side projects) that it's impossible to ban, it's a positive feedback loop since it was designed as a win win system.
- And the best part is it's already too late
- This is based on my favorite bitcoin article of all time, and is probably the inspiration for my lifelong dedication
- Cross signature input aggregation
- Lightning network
- 9/16/23 another thing I realized, in the same vein as the Trojan horse, because governments will never give up their currency, and regulated markets. Bitcoin will probably not be a medium and exchange, and will instead be an asset. But because Bitcoin can serve both functions, the medium of exchange aspect of Bitcoin can be reserved for those people and industries, which need a medium of exchange outside of the regulated system, and the adoption of Bitcoin, as an asset by your regulated part of the economy, will act as a stabilizing force for the value of bitcoin, and even make it an appreciating asset, volatility goes down as theres less and less supply actually trading, i.e. the store of value aspect of bitcoin keeps it as a stronger freedom tool for those who need it most

[Bitcoin is a Trojan Horse for freedom](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom/)  
As human rights activists know well, it can be hard to effectively promote freedom in a society that willingly sells morals out for profit. Bitcoin sneaks in and rewires the system from the inside, aligning profit seeking with permissionless financial liberation.  
But who conjured this horse and dragged it to the city gates?  
This time, it was not a plotting army camped outside Wall Street. Satoshi’s creation spreads not by force, but by voluntary choice. The financial establishment is simply beginning to like the way it looks. It promises great riches, and that is no mirage: it will continue to deliver. But most of the elites do not realize what they are bringing into the inner sanctum.
 
And Bitcoin is more clever than any Trojan Horse that Virgil or Homer could have imagined. In this plotline, each individual can custody their bitcoin by moving it to an address they control with a set of digital keys. Unlike in 1933, when the U.S. government was able to seize the gold of citizens with Executive Order 6102 by attacking points of custody, that does not work if hundreds of thousands or even millions of Americans are holding their keys. The adoption process is creating millions of new fortresses in cyberspace, all more secure than Troy.
 
The ancient Greeks and Romans would appreciate the irony of megacorps and governments willingly and even enthusiastically letting the one thing that can erode their growing power into their city gates. Number Go Up is one hell of a drug.
 
In some ways, Bitcoin has succeeded so far by hiding behind its strangeness. Just as the Trojans were baffled by the monstrous horse standing outside their city gates, the establishment has balked at Bitcoin. It has gone from $0 to $60,000 with most people on earth not batting an eye. Less than 2 percent of humans have adopted it, but more than that, it seems, have mocked it. Even today, in April 2021, virtually all top economists, political scientists, diplomats and central bankers still dismiss Bitcoin as something that will not work or is not worth their time. This dismissal has allowed Bitcoin to grow largely unfettered. And now the horse has been rolled inside the city.
 
At this point, the reader may think Bitcoin proponents must be saying, “Quiet in the back! Keep the noise down. We just need to last a few more hours until midnight, and then we can pop ourselves out of this horse and let the rest of our army into Troy.” But it is already too late. There is nothing the Trojans can do.
