Bitcoin is also superior collateral  
==bitcoin is super collateral. But what makes it so unique?==  
==We can identify twelve characteristics that make it so:==  
**BITCOIN IS LIQUID**  
==Bitcoin is an extremely liquid asset. It is traded 24/7, with no weekend breaks and no banking holidays. Massive liquidity pools across a variety of fiat currencies are available globally. For lenders, this means that if you want to convert your collateral into fiat, you can do it instantly — either because the borrower has been liquidated or because the loan was repaid from the collateral.==  
==This also allows for the hedging of risks. Bitcoin may be the only kind of loan collateral which can be instantly and dynamically hedged: a serious competitive advantage.==  
**BITCOIN IS PROGRAMMABLE**  
==Bitcoin enables the creation of programmable lending products and ownership mechanisms. Among other benefits, this feature allows us to solve the problem of trusted third parties by building non-custodial lending mechanisms and storage systems. For example, we can distribute collateral claims or create conditional logic for redemption that will be automatically executed by the Bitcoin network, not the whims of a centralized financial institution.==  
**BITCOIN IS SCARCE**  
==There will only be 21 million bitcoin.Your collateral is getting more valuable over time, which means there is less incentive for you to sell, and likely more lenders who are willing to accept it.==  
**BITCOIN IS FLEXIBLY TRANSPARENT**  
==Bitcoin allows us to enable selective transparency of your assets when useful, but also allows complete anonymity when desired. In a lending scenario, for example, you can easily prove to a lender that you own and control the collateral under consideration.==  
**BITCOIN IS SOVEREIGN**  
==Bitcoin is yours. You have keys to your bitcoin just like you have keys to your house and your car. Bitcoin is your personal property. If you use a house or a car as collateral, you won't own it — your lender would. With bitcoin, you can still conditionally own it during your lending agreement. In fact, with the right tools, you can not only use but continue to use this collateral during the period of the lending agreement.==  
**BITCOIN IS SECURE**  
==Bitcoin is protected cryptographically, economically and socially. It is sensible to think of Bitcoin's lowest-level network security expanding to the set of tools built on top of it. For example, you can distribute ownership of your collateral between multiple independent parties, use offline wallets and utilize many more security methods.==  
**BITCOIN IS MARKET DRIVEN**  
==Bitcoin is the essence of a market-driven asset. The price of bitcoin reflects the market almost instantly, and it's not determined by one or several individuals. It is extremely difficult to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin costs almost the same in fiat in any part of the world and is determined by a global market.==  
**BITCOIN IS A REAL-TIME ASSET**  
==Not only can we track the price of bitcoin collateral in real time, but Bitcoin's== ==blockchain== ==allows you to track your collateral address in real time also. Any price fluctuation can be reacted to appropriately. As mentioned, there are no weekends or holidays, and the market is always open to everyone, so nobody will close the market on a Friday and open on a Monday with different prices.==  
**BITCOIN IS OBJECTIVE**  
==Bitcoin is honest. Bitcoin in Miami costs the same amount of fiat as it does in Lugano or Riga. Bitcoin doesn't care whether you like it or not. The price of bitcoin cannot be determined by your personal views or your forecasting capabilities. To borrow against bitcoin, you only need to have bitcoin. Your credit history, social score or anything else is irrelevant to the lender as long as you have the collateral to borrow against.==

Fidelity Store of Value paper  
Many investors consider bitcoin to be an aspirational store of value because it  
possesses the properties of a store of value, even though it has yet to be widely  
accepted as such.  
• A potential silver lining of bitcoin’s volatility, at least in these early days, is that  
it is a catalyst that has attracted attention, development, and innovation.  
• Scarcity is a key property of a good store of value because it is essential  
for helping to protect against the long-term depreciation of real value.  
One of bitcoin’s most novel innovations is its programmed digital scarcity.  
• Bitcoin’s scarcity was coded into the protocol when it was created. The  
independence of Bitcoin’s monetary policy is enforced by a decentralized  
network of computers supporting the network and proof-of-work.  
• The U.S.’ rising fiscal deficit and rising interest rates have led to annualized  
interest payments of approximately $1 trillion, potentially adding fuel to  
awareness and adoption of bitcoin in the U.S. Longer-term drivers include  
catalysts such as the great wealth transfer to a Millennial demographic that  
has expressed a much more favorable opinion on digital assets than have  
older generations.
