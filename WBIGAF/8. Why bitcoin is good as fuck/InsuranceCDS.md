And here's the really cool thing: there's no counterparty risk.

- Bitcoin is not an insurance company. When you hold it in self-custody, you don't have to worry about buying this insurance from an insurance company like Bear Stearns.
- See, when I was trading credit default swaps, I had an exposure to Bear Stearns that meant I thought I was gonna have insurance from Bear Stearns. And guess what! When Bear Stearns looked like it was gonna fail, I had to run out and buy insurance on my insurance company. You see how this whole circular thing works?
- Bitcoin is so beautiful because there's no counterparty. So there's a way to value it and there's the way to appreciate that it has no counterparty risk.
- And then you could say to me, "Well, Greg isn't the same thing said about gold?" And I'd just go, "Yes and no. " Because gold has no fixed supply, It's not transferable or portable like Bitcoin is, and most importantly its not auditable. There is no blockchain to audit it. And I still like gold. Don't get me wrong. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is so superior, as not only a technology, but also as an auditable asset. That is why I love Bitcoin as effectively, in my view from a credit trader's perspective my whole life, it is the most beautiful insurance policy of the failure of fiats globally.
   

- Foss views Bitcoin as insurance against sovereign debt default, suggesting it's currently undervalued.
- He likens Bitcoin to credit default swaps (CDS), stating it could be worth 1/7 of its value for the USA alone.
- Foss emphasizes Bitcoin's lack of counterparty risk compared to traditional CDS.
- He argues that Bitcoin's unmanipulated market and various valuation perspectives contribute to its attractiveness, asserting it's an exceptional investment opportunity.
 
Sure, let's break down the math behind Greg Foss's argument about Bitcoin as insurance and how he arrives at the $700,000 valuation:

- Bitcoin as Insurance and Credit Default Swap (CDS): Foss likens Bitcoin to a special kind of insurance called a credit default swap (CDS). A CDS is like insurance against a country not being able to repay its debts. In this case, Bitcoin would act as insurance against countries failing to meet their financial obligations. Foss argues that Bitcoin is even better than traditional CDS because it doesn't rely on a specific company; it's its own thing.
- Valuing Bitcoin with CDS: Foss uses the concept of CDS to estimate how much Bitcoin could be worth if it were used as insurance against countries' debts. He considers the total amount of debt that countries owe. For instance, he starts with the United States and its debt, which is about $200 trillion (both funded and unfunded liabilities).
- CDS Calculation: Foss uses a calculation involving a value called the CDS spread, which is like a premium for the insurance. He uses the 5-year CDS spread for the US, which is around 40 basis points (0.4%). For every $10 million of US debt, it costs $40,000 per year to insure against default. He extrapolates this for different time periods (like 20 years) to estimate a CDS value for the US.
- Applying to Other Countries: Foss then extends this CDS idea to include other countries, like the G7 and G20 nations, which represent powerful economies. He adds up the potential CDS values for all these countries.
- Arriving at $700,000 Valuation: By using this approach, Foss suggests that Bitcoin could be worth over $700,000 per unit. He reaches this number by dividing the total estimated CDS value (from all the countries) by the total number of Bitcoins in existence. He argues that if people consider Bitcoin as a form of insurance against global debt, its value could increase significantly.
- In essence, Foss's argument involves considering Bitcoin as a type of insurance against countries' financial problems. He uses the concept of credit default swaps to estimate a potential value for Bitcoin based on its role as this unique form of insurance, arriving at the figure of $700,000.

Since bitcoin possesses all of the attributes that are desired in a Fed put gamma squeeze, and since bitcoin has no counterparty risk and there is no time restriction (no theta) on the contract, it can reasonably be concluded that bitcoin is the perfect exotic option and the perfect insurance against an unravelling of the global fiat system.
 
Bitcoin is insurance, and over time as the narrative solidifies it's
