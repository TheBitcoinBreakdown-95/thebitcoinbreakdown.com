- How bitcoin works, it's just a ledger that has a bunch of UTXOs on it, keys can change the ledger
- Bitcoin keys are just numbers
- Bitcoin code is protected by the first amendment
- Money can either be physical or a ledger, Before the invention of bitcoin, information could just be copied on the internet which is why you needed a single centralized source of truth, you couldn't have a physical token in the informational realm, the genius of bitcoin was to find a way to have scarcity in the informational realm
- If I have an apple and you have an apple and we trade we still only have one apple…
- Steganography
- Brain wallets
- There's never been a money that's pure information, so it's hard to explain, nothing like this has ever existed
 
- Bitcoin has the highest value density of all assets since it is pure information, it can be magically beamed across the internet. You could have a billion dollars worth of bitcoin in your head, retaining your wealth even if stripped naked."

Due to its lack of physicality, there is no limit to what shape your bitcoin might have: text, QR codes, images, sound, artworks, emojis - the only limiting factor is our imagination (more on that in Chapter 17). Whether we are talking about storage or the transmission of transactions, Bitcoin can shapeshift into anything it needs to be. This magical property is, in part, what makes Bitcoin so resilient to censorship. Bitcoin transactions can be encoded into pretty much anything, and - of course - they can be sent via end-to-end encrypted communication channels, making them completely unrecognizable. How can you censor something if you can’t tell what you’re looking at?

Since the internet's inception, there's been a relentless trend towards dematerialization.
 
Remember BlockBuster Video? Dematerialized by Netflix's streaming revolution.
 
Kodak's physical film? Replaced by the instant gratification of Instagram and digital photography.
 
Tower Records and its physical albums? Made obsolete by Napster, Apple, and the convenience of digital music (MP3s).
 
What about publishing giants like The NY Times and LA Times? They've lost their relevance to the internet's immediacy and the diverse voices of social media.
 
This shift illustrates a fundamental truth: when the digital version of an analog entity emerges, it inevitably leads to the analog's decline in relevance.
 
The digital version not only trends towards being virtually cost-free relative to its physical counterpart, but it also gains the unparalleled advantage of moving around the globe at the speed of light, with minimal friction. In essence, digitization elevates something into its most efficient and accessible form.
 
Now, apply this lens to money. #Bitcoin  is at the forefront of dematerializing everything we've known as money - including the 160+ fiat currencies and even gold. It's not just a digital currency; it's the epitome of what money should be in the digital age: a system with rules but no rulers.
 
Bitcoin embodies the pinnacle of financial evolution: a decentralized, rule-based system that's not bound by the whims of any single governing body. After thousands of years, we're witnessing the dawn of true monetary liberation.
