Now, what would happen if there was no bank? Who decides who was the first one to swipe? What if it wasn’t only you two, but hundreds or even thousands of people coordi­nating? What if you didn’t trust those people? What if some of those people are trying to cheat, e.g., by setting their clocks back so that it looks like they spent the money a couple of minutes earlier?
 
A time-related tool [is] needed to estab­lish a canon­ical ordering and to enforce a unique history in the absence of any central coordi­nator. -Giacomo Zucco, Discov­ering Bitcoin (2019)
 
This problem is precisely why all previous attempts of digital cash required a central­ized registry. You always had to trust someone to correctly identify the order of things. A central­ized party was required to keep the time.
 
Bitcoin solves this problem by re-inventing time itself. It says no to seconds and yes to blocks.
 
In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distrib­uted timestamp server to generate compu­ta­tional proof of the chrono­log­ical order of trans­ac­tions. -Satoshi Nakamoto (2009)
