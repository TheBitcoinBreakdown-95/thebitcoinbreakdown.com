- Internet of money
    
    1. Saying Bitcoin is digital gold is like saying the internet is a fancy telephone
    2. Bitcoin is the native currency of the internet, but it's more than that, it's the internet of money
    3. The internet is programmable information, bitcoin is programmable money
    4. The internet is decentralized information, bitcoin is decentralized money
    
    The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage From \<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)\>
    
      
    
    1. What is TC/IP and how was it designed?
        1. Internet layers - the internet is like an onion
            1. Cramming everything into one layer is confusing, inefficient, hard to adjust, and overly complex. It's built in logical steps to build on the functions of the layers beneath it
        2. Bitcoin - is like an onion
            1. After some research I'm realizing bitcoin is more like the IP layer, a data network layer, where transactions are broadcasted, verified and recorded, and the contents of the messages/transactions don't matter
                1. How this relates to the UDP/TCP layers is in Lightning (UDP) -
            2. The concept of abstraction, compartmentalizing certain functionalities for flexibility and adaptability
    2. The value transfer protocol (show puzzle picture)
        1. Mail transfer protocol is different from the regular internet
        2. Do your research on internet infrastructure
            1. Bitcoin is the value transfer protocol
                1. Like IP deals
    3. "A network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation."
    4. Democratizes value, like the internet democratizes information
    5. It’s a decentralized internet
        1. Combining its programmability with immutable bedrock foundation
        2. Layers and layers can be added to it, just like with the regular internet
    6. A monetary system not only needs money
        1. It needs transfer services, it needs storage, accounting systems, options contracts, trading platforms, insurance, crowdfunding, payment infrastructure, liquidity
    7. Bitcoin is global public monetary infrastructure
        1. Find a good Jack Mallers quote
    8. Statechains, liquid side chains, RGB, rootstock, Lightning, nostr marketplaces, Fedimint and ecash, taproot assets, DLCs,
    9. AI, robots, self driving cars, smart homes, programming and using public digital money infrastructure in a robot economy separate from our own
    10. Social media, creator economies, Metaverse, esports, ecommerce,
    11. BUT - why bitcoin and not Eth, isn't bitcoin + eth + altcoins the real internet of money?
        1. While yes we will have a multicoin world, and multiple smart contract platforms and decentralized nodes and relay infrastructure facilitating communications and payments, bitcoin prioritizes simplicity and security and is immutable. It's the stronger base layer internet of money.
        2. And due to bitcoin's strong monetary characteristics, even if other blockchains carry the weight of the IoM infrastructure in the future, bitcoin will always be the gold standard, the digital gold and the golden network that's completely uncontrollable and immutable to mankind.
      
           
Bitcoin is less like AOL or Myspace, and more like TCP/IP – the base layer protocols of the internet
 
In the early days of the internet there was competition amongst new entrants and protocol designs, but in the end TCP/IP won out. Not because of some complex utility or functionality at the base layer, but because it was an agreed upon and simple rules based system.
      
- Bitcoin isn't like apple pay, it's not like having a bank account, bitcoin is like having an entire swiss bank on your cell phone. 
- The key insight that flipped the switch for me personally and got me to realize what bitcoin ACTUALLY is:
- Bitcoin will not be the "money" used for every transaction but it will become the foundation that money is layered upon.
- We're talking a new global financial and monetary system,
- remade on top of bitcoin
- There's a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize - Bitcoin is base layer monetary infrastructure, the world economy will be built on top of bitcoin            

Most importantly, Bitcoin offers an open API to create secure, scriptable e-cash transactions. Just as the web democratized publishing and development, Bitcoin can democratize building new financial services. Contracts can be entered into, verified, and enforced completely electronically, using any third-party that you care to trust, or by the code itself. For free, within minutes, without possibility of forgery or revocation. Any competent programmer has an API to cash, payments, escrow, wills, notaries, lotteries, dividends, micropayments, subscriptions, crowdfunding, and more. While the traditional banks and credit card companies lock down access to their payments infrastructure to a handful of trusted parties, Bitcoin is open to all.
 
Silicon Valley knows a platform when it sees it, and is aflame with Bitcoin. Teams of brilliant young programmers, entranced by the opportunity, are working on Exchanges (Payward, Buttercoin, Varum), Futures Markets (ICBIT), Hardware Wallets (BitCoinCard, Trezor, etc), Payment Processors (bitpay.com), Banks, Escrow companies, Vaults, Mobile Wallets, Remittance Networks (bitinstant.com), Local Trading networks (localbitcoins.com), and more.

[Bitcoin: Introduction to the Internet of Money](https://youtu.be/rc744Z9IjhY)
 - Andreas talks a lot about bitcoin as information - As the asset’s open source software evolves, bitcoin will distinguish itself further from other asset classes. Innovations like segregated witness can catalyze bitcoin’s more innovative uses cases. Sidechains and smart contracts could allow new financial services such as liquid private markets and peer-to-peer loan issuance.
\> From \<[https://www.ccn.com/why-bitcoin-is-a-new-asset-class/](https://www.ccn.com/why-bitcoin-is-a-new-asset-class/)\>   - One of my favorite bitcoin educators Andreas Antonopoulos explains the internet of money as: "A network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation."
    - There's a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize
-   
     
"Bitcoin is digital public infrastructure for money, much like the internet is digital public infrastructure for information…it is owned by no one, and accessible to everyone. It is a public good that acts as infrastructure for civilization to utilize if they so please.

**The internet of money**  
==According to Howard, “The more users a network has, the more valuable it is, and there’s a clear parallel between== ==bitcoin====, the monetary protocol, and TCP/IP, the internet protocol. TCP/IP was created in the 70s, battled in the ‘protocol wars’ during the 80s, and clearly had the winning network effect in the 90s, rendering its competitors obsolete. The Internet community was nimble – able to develop in months what took the Open-Source Initiative years – but it scared off some potential adopters because nobody seemed ‘in charge.’ Even more so, absolutely nobody is in charge of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the TCP/IP of money.”==  
==Bitcoin’s core design has been set in stone from day one. It is available as open-source code for all to see, with no central power overseeing its development or manipulating monetary policy. Its scarcity cannot be replicated, helping it to retain its value over time, while it is also substantially more robust and more secure than many of its peers, thanks to its decentralized nature.==
 
==But to become the monetary protocol for everything requires one further feature – the ability to determine who owns what and when, precisely, and uncontestably. Again, bitcoin’s immutable ledger stands alone in this respect. It’s a one-of-a-kind technology capable of establishing time flow (and thus, the transfer of value) in the digital realm.==

==Tapiero’s profound knowledge in macro investing and comprehensive grasp of the worldwide financial landscape enables him to provide valuable perspectives on various subjects. These include the enduring significance of gold as an asset and the transformative possibilities presented by bitcoin.==  
==Tapiero directed his focus towards bitcoin, characterizing it as a “====monetary== ==and societal revolution.” He contended that bitcoin goes beyond just a mere asset class, portraying it as an== ==innovative technology== ==and an expansive network.==  
==Drawing attention to its growing stage of development, Tapiero highlighted bitcoin’s current position as a $1 trillion market, in contrast to gold’s $12 trillion market.==  
==Nevertheless, he expressed unwavering faith in bitcoin’s potential for substantial growth in the future. Drawing an analogy to the early 1990s era of the internet, he suggested that the current stage of bitcoin’s evolution is similar to the initial stages of the internet, thereby implying that we have only just glimpsed the immense possibilities that bitcoin can ultimately achieve.==

- How the internet works
- Bitcoin is a broadcast network, and settlement network
- When the internet was invented, the base layer couldn't handle huge amounts of data, would be impossible to send pictures or video
 
We are screwing up in our design of internet protocols by violating the￼principle of layering. Specifically we are trying to use TCP to do two￼things: serve as a host level end to end protocol, and to serve as an￼internet packaging and routing protocol. These two things should be￼provided in a layered and modular way. I suggest that a new distinct￼internetwork protocol is needed, and that TCP be used strictly as a host￼level end to end protocol. I also believe that if TCP is used only in￼this cleaner way it can be simplified somewhat.

==The Internet is a dumb network, which is its defining and most valuable feature. The Internet’s protocol (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, or TCP/IP) doesn’t offer “services.” It doesn’t make decisions about content. It doesn’t distinguish between photos and text, video and audio. It doesn’t have a list of approved applications. It doesn’t even distinguish between client and server, user and host, or individual versus corporation. Every IP address is an equal peer.==  
==TCP/IP acts as an efficient pipeline, moving data from one point to another. Over time, it has had some minor adjustments to offer some differentiated “quality of service” capabilities, but other than that, it remains, for the most part, a dumb data pipeline. Almost all the intelligence is on the edge== ==— all the services, all the applications are created on the edge-devices. Creating a new application does not involve changing the network. The Web, voice, video, and social media were all created as applications on the edge without any need to modify the Internet protocol.==
 \> From \<[https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/](https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/)\>   
Bitcoin is the Internet of money. It offers a basic dumb network that connects peers from anywhere in the world. The bitcoin network itself does not define any financial services or applications. It doesn’t require membership registration or identification. It doesn’t control the types of devices or applications that can live on its edge. Bitcoin offers one service: securely time-stamped scripted transactions. Everything else is built on the edge-devices as an application. Bitcoin allows any application to be developed independently, without permission, on the edge of the network. A developer can create a new application using the transactional service as a platform and deploy it on any device. Even niche applications with few users — applications never envisioned by the bitcoin protocol creator — can be built and deployed.
 \> From \<[https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/](https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/)\>   
Now bitcoin provides an open network platform for financial services on top of the open and decentralized Internet. The financial services built on top of bitcoin are themselves open because they are not “services” delivered by the network; they are “apps” running on top of the network.
 \> From \<[https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/](https://fee.org/articles/decentralization-why-dumb-networks-are-better/)\>      
UDP and TCP are both built on top of the IP layer in the networking stack. They operate horizontally within the protocol stack, meaning they are peers at the same layer while relying on the services provided by the IP layer beneath them.
 
The apparent paradox of faster performance in higher layers despite the perceived sluggishness of the underlying layers, such as IP, can be attributed to the differing design objectives and trade-offs among these layers.
 
IP, as a network layer protocol, is designed to route packets across networks efficiently, but it doesn't inherently prioritize speed or latency for individual data units. It handles addressing, routing, and forwarding of packets, which involves decision-making processes based on network topology and available paths.
 
TCP, a transport layer protocol, builds upon the services offered by IP. While it introduces reliability and sequencing mechanisms for data delivery, such as acknowledgment and retransmission, these features inevitably introduce some overhead in terms of processing and latency. The protocol's design intent is to guarantee data accuracy and order, even if it comes at the expense of speed.
 
UDP, another transport layer protocol, also sits atop IP. It emphasizes speed and low latency over rigorous error-checking and retransmission mechanisms. UDP sacrifices some reliability in favor of rapid data transmission. It's particularly suitable for applications that prioritize timeliness, like real-time video or voice streaming.
 
The seemingly counterintuitive faster performance in higher layers is a result of these trade-offs. Layers above IP, such as UDP, optimize for specific use cases and performance requirements. By relinquishing some of the extensive reliability measures of the layers beneath them, they achieve greater speed and lower latency. This scenario illustrates the intricate balance between accuracy, speed, and efficiency within the layered networking model.
   

_____  
Imagine sending a big box of puzzle pieces to your friend. The IP layer's role is to make sure the box gets to your friend's house, regardless of how fast it travels. The layers above (like TCP and UDP) influence how quickly the puzzle pieces are put together once they arrive. TCP might ensure that each piece is in perfect condition and arrives in order, but this thoroughness takes time. UDP might focus on putting the puzzle together as quickly as possible, even if it means a few pieces are missing or out of order.

Programmable money for all of us:  
at the end of the day, Bitcoin is programmable money. When you have programmable money, The possibilities are truly endless. We can take many of the basic concepts of the current system that depend on legal contracts, and we can convert these into algorithmic contracts, into mathematical transactions that can be enforced on the Bitcoin net work. As I’ve said, there is no third-party, there is no counter party. If I choose to send value from one part of the network to another, it is peer to peer with no one in between. If I invent a new form of money, I can deploy it to the entire world, and invite others to come and join me.  
“ bitcoin is the Internet of money. Currency is only the first application. And it’s core, Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever.”  
bitcoin is not just money for the Internet. Yes, it’s perfect money for the Internet. It’s instant, it’s safe, it’s free. Yes, it’s money for the Internet, but it’s so much more. Bitcoin is the Internet of money. Currency is only the first application. If you grasp that, you can look beyond the price, you can look beyond the volatility, you can look beyond fed. At its core, Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever. - Andreas The internet of Money vol. 1
             
SMTP  
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) operates on top of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) layer. SMTP is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages between servers. It relies on the reliability and ordering guarantees provided by TCP to ensure that email messages are accurately transmitted from the sender's email server to the recipient's email server.
                  

Bitcoin Protocol:  
The Bitcoin protocol itself operates at a network layer, similar to IP. It provides the foundational rules for how transactions are created, verified, and added to the blockchain. Like IP, Bitcoin ensures that transactions are reliably transmitted across the network, but it doesn't inherently focus on speed or low-latency.
 
Lightning Network:  
The Lightning Network, on the other hand, is more akin to a higher layer protocol like TCP or UDP. It's a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network is designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions by allowing users to conduct multiple off-chain transactions before settling on the main blockchain. It's like creating a "speed lane" for Bitcoin transactions, similar to how TCP and UDP add additional functionality on top of the IP layer to prioritize speed or specific use cases.
 
Verification and Immutability:  
The blockchain's verification and immutability characteristics are inherent to the Bitcoin protocol, making Bitcoin itself more analogous to both IP and TCP. Just as IP ensures the accurate transmission of data packets, Bitcoin's protocol ensures the secure and verified transmission of transactions. Additionally, the Bitcoin blockchain's immutability, where confirmed transactions cannot be altered, aligns with TCP's emphasis on reliable and ordered delivery.
 
In essence, while there are parallels between networking layers and Bitcoin's protocol and the Lightning Network, the unique aspects of blockchain technology and the layers within Bitcoin's ecosystem might not perfectly map to traditional networking analogies. However, your analogy does capture the idea that the Bitcoin protocol functions as a foundational layer (IP-like), while the Lightning Network serves as a higher-layer solution focused on speed and efficiency (UDP/TCP-like).
 
____
 
While Bitcoin's layers might not have a one-to-one correspondence with the layers in traditional networking models, they do share some fundamental principles and goals, especially in terms of flexibility, functionality, and abstraction.
 
Flexibility in Evolving Technologies:  
Both traditional networking models and Bitcoin's layers are designed with the flexibility to adapt to evolving technologies. Just as the layers in traditional networking can be upgraded or replaced to accommodate changing needs, Bitcoin's layers can be enhanced through protocol upgrades to address scalability, security, and usability challenges.
 
Improving Overall Functionality:  
Both approaches aim to improve the overall functionality and performance of the system. In traditional networking, layers are optimized to handle specific tasks more efficiently. Similarly, in Bitcoin, the layers are structured to address different aspects of the protocol, such as transaction validation and speed, all contributing to a better user experience.
 
Abstraction for Complexity Management:  
Both traditional networking and Bitcoin's layers embrace the principle of abstraction. They break down complex tasks into manageable components or layers. This abstraction makes it easier to understand, develop, and maintain complex systems by isolating different functionalities. This also enables more modular development, allowing changes in one layer without affecting the others.
 
In both cases, the goal is to create structured systems that are adaptable, efficient, and manageable. So, even though the layers in Bitcoin might not directly match traditional networking layers, they share core principles that stem from the need to handle complexity and optimize functionality in dynamic and evolving environments.
         

Bitcoin is the Internet of Money  
[AUGUST 7, 2023](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/bitcoin-is-the-internet-of-money/)[THEBITCOINBREAKDOWN](https://thebitcoinbreakdown.com/author/thebitcoinbreakdown/)  
Money is just the base layer of an economic system, just like BTC is the base layer of the bitcoin economy. The difference is bitcoin is also a network, a tech stack, and a protocol. Digital and programmable monetary infrastructure.  
BTC is the native money of the internet, but bitcoin is much more than that. Bitcoin is the internet of money.

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020251228194706-0.png)

In order for you to understand what bitcoin is, you unfortunately have to understand what the internet is.  
_The_ **Internet** _(or_ **internet**_)__[a]_ _is the global system of interconnected_ _computer networks_ _that uses the_ _Internet protocol suite_ _(TCP/IP)__[b]_ _to communicate between networks and devices. It is a_ _network of networks__…_  
_Wikipedia_  
The internet is programmable information. It is unrestricted, global, instantly transferable information. Bitcoin is programmable money – unrestricted, global, and instantly transferable money.  
The internet is decentralized informational infrastructure, bitcoin is decentralized monetary infrastructure. The internet is an information protocol that can be built upon. Bitcoin is a money protocol that can be built upon.  
_Bitcoin is digital public infrastructure for money, much like the internet is digital public infrastructure for information…it is owned by no one, and accessible to everyone. It is a public good that acts as infrastructure for civilization to utilize if they so please._   
_Jack Mallers_  
Bitcoin democratizes value in the same way that the internet democratizes information.  
The internet has allowed the coordination of humanity on a scale never before seen in human history, allowing for knowledge and revolutionary ideas to spread like wildfire. Bitcoin allows for unrestricted financing, pairing global coordination with unrestricted payments, fundraising, contracts, monetary autonomy and value exchange.  
There’s no one in charge of the internet, there’s no central governing body dictating policy. And unlike all other cryptocurrencies, there’s no one in charge of bitcoin. This makes bitcoin the only true neutral money transfer protocol and the most similar to the internet protocol.  
Bitcoin is less like an app, like AOL or Myspace, and more like TCP/IP, or UDP or SMTP. It’s part of the internet infrastructure responsible for transferring value. With bitcoin the information is the money, making it fully integrable into the internet stack.

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020251228194707-1.png)

Of course a monetary system not only needs money. It needs transfer services, it needs storage, accounting systems, exchanges, options contracts, trading platforms, insurance, crowdfunding, payment infrastructure, liquidity services, interoperable financial infrastructure etc. Bitcoin is the money but it’s also the platform where all other monetary system functionalities can be built.  
_Bitcoin is the Internet of money. Currency is only the first application. And it’s core, Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever_  
 _Andreas Antonopoulos -The internet of Money vol. 1_  
Bitcoin’s design allows for apps to be built on it’s periphery completely without permission. It’s open source and anyone can build a program that uses bitcoin and adds functionality to the network.  
Complex custody solutions and transaction types unlocked by outputs like pay to script hash increase the types of possible transactions and improve user privacy and security. Upgrades to the software like Segwit have allowed for greater base chain scaling and for layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network to be built on top of bitcoin. And more recently the Taproot upgrade has unlocked additional smart contract functionality and privacy improvements to the bitcoin stack allowing for all kinds of options contracts and insurance capabilities.  
Bitcoin is the Foundation of a Global Monetary and Financial system  
Those examples are just scratching the surface though, the bitcoin tech stack rabbit hole goes way further than this simple introduction. From the BTC Pay server, to statechains and sidechains, to RGB, ARK, Web5, Rootstock, Sovereign defi, Miniscript, Stratum V2, Federated Chaumian mints, Ordinals, L402, Stablesats, Taproot assets, Nostr marketplaces and many more. Of course this is not even counting other projects yet to be imagined or built with additional soft fork upgrades like CTV or Cross Input Signature Aggregation.  
The industries that will integrate into the internet of money are truly boundless. Social media’s creator economies, AR and the VR Metaverses, eSports, and eCommerce will all be connected this global and frictionless monetary system.  
What’s truly revolutionary though is that because bitcoin is open and permissionless monetary infrastructure, the internet of money isn’t limited to just humans. AI, robots, self driving cars, smart homes, drones, and the unimagined future of the internet of things can all leverage bitcoin’s programmability and use this public internet-based money infrastructure in a digital economy completely separate from our own.  
_Bitcoin is the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation._  
_Mastering Bitcoin_  
The internet is a network of informational networks, bitcoin is a network of monetary networks. Different layers and protocols are being built on top, using the base layer as a settlement network and arbiter of ownership for more advanced use cases. The bitcoin stack is much more than just a money protocol, money is just scratching the surface.  
If this is all still not making perfect sense to you, this is the key insight that flipped the switch for me personally and made me realize what bitcoin actually is:  
Bitcoin will not necessarily be the “money” used for every transaction. It’s aiming for something much greater. Bitcoin will become the foundational protocol that the future digital economy and all global monies will be built upon.  
We’re talking a new global financial and monetary system, remade on top of bitcoin. Transferring ownership of real world assets like stocks and bonds and fiat currencies themselves.  
The reason this is so revolutionary is because it’s a system that’s based on the money and network being decentralized, independent, and uncontrollable.  
A revolutionary economic system, built with technology. Based on rules not rulers.  
The separation of money and state.  
Why is bitcoin the internet of money and not the larger crypto ecosystem?  
The obvious reaction to this of course is, bitcoin is just one blockchain network among an entire crypto ecosystem, why BTC and not ETH, SOL, ADA, ALGO, TRX, MATIC, ATOM, AVAX…..  
Isn’t bitcoin + (insert favorite Turing complete smart contract platform) + Layer 2 rollups + defi + metaverse + corporate FinTech platforms = the real internet of money?  
While yes we will have a multi-coin world, and multiple smart contract platforms and decentralized nodes and relay infrastructure facilitating communications and payments, bitcoin is by far the strongest base layer internet of money. Bitcoin is unparalleled in it’s decentralization and immutable monetary policy, it’s a Turing incomplete blockchain which prioritizes simplicity, security, and durability.  
And due to bitcoin’s strong monetary characteristics, even if other blockchains carry the weight of the IoM infrastructure in the future, bitcoin will always be the gold standard, the digital gold and the golden network that’s completely uncontrollable and immutable to mankind. Combining its neutrality, durability and programmability with an immutable bedrock foundation, bitcoin takes the slow and steady approach to outlast all other monetary infrastructure. Over time the bitcoin network will adopt the successful innovations in the larger crypto space to it’s superior network, leaving other platforms obsolete.  
Looking into the Future  
To achieve the title of the sole money and monetary system of the future, bitcoin has many challenges ahead of itself. The entrenched fiat capitalist system and competitor crypto networks probably wont go away anytime soon. It took hundreds of years for the separation of church and state, and to think a system as complex as the global economy will be quick to transition is naïve at best.  
As a pragmatist I would concede that the likelihood of full market share of the global economy within my lifetime is slim and might not happen for a hundred years. Instead, what I believe is that there will most likely be a multi-chain world and parallel fiat economy for the foreseeable future.  
The reason why this is good is because bitcoin will always exist as a voluntary life raft for others to join (Instead of rapidly destroying the global economy, with bitcoin endogenously reborn from fiat ashes).  
The fact that an internet based, neutral, and unchangeable economic system exists as an alternative will put a check on the expansionist policies of the other systems. They can exist in harmony as the cost of capital is rediscovered on the open market and the overleveraged fiat system course corrects.  
Instead of a seismic shift and quick destruction of the old system, the bitcoin onboarding process (should) and will take time. That’s honestly what’s so exciting. We’re building revolutionary systems that will last generations.
