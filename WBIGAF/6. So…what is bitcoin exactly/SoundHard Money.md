The world needs a hard money  
There are so many benefits  
For there to be a new money that’s harder than anything that came before or since and it can be transported around the world at the speed of light permissionlessly , available to all of humanity even those that live on a dollar a day,  
It’s not captured by elites in any way shape or form it’s a completely neutral third-party technology, open source software, that was built by an anonymous programmer who left the project as a gift to humanity
 
You can't have capitalism without sound money
 
In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Nakamoto made it clear he was inspired to create bitcoin in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, which highlighted the dangers of the Federal Reserve’s manipulation of money and the abuses of powerful Wall Street banks.

1. Sound money is as necessary as a constitution
2. Bitcoin is one of a kind, has no competition, and is the sound money of the internet and of the future
3. (Fuck I had a third one in my dream that was a mic drop but maybe I'll remember)   

If sound money is a systemic risk to your financial system then the system is literally garbage
     
A note on monetary properties and sound money  
Gold fails in divisibility, portability and verifiability, so silver was used for most of history in a bi-metalism standard, where silver solved for divisibility and portability and then the royal stamp of the king's head on a coin made it easily verifiable. However bimetalism isn't perfect since it has inflation and different rates of inflation, and still wasn't portable over telecommunications infrastructure, and was doomed to fail.
      
16. Bitcoin's architecture embodies the Austrian economic doctrine of sound money.
17. Drawing from Austrian economics, Bitcoin was meticulously crafted with sound money fundamentals at its core.
18. Inspired by the tenets of Austrian economics, Bitcoin's creation was a direct application of sound money principles.
19. At the heart of Bitcoin's inception lies the embodiment of Austrian economic principles of sound money.

Ludwig von Mises argues that sound money is an instrument for the protection of civil liberties and a means of limiting government power (1912)
 
Ludwig von Mises  
Found in The Theory of Money and Credit
 
The Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), argues in The Theory of Money and Credit (1912) that "sound money" was a crucial part of classical liberal theory because it was the market’s choice of a commonly used medium of exchange and also a method for obstructing the government’s propensity to meddle with the currency system:
 
The principle of sound money that guided nineteenth-century monetary doctrines and policies was a product of classical political economy. It was an essential part of the liberal program as developed by eighteenth-century social philosophy and propagated in the following century by the most influential political parties of Europe and America… **It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights**. The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the nonobservance of old customs by kings. The postulate of sound money was first brought up as a response to the princely practice of debasing the coinage. It was later carefully elaborated and perfected in the age which—through the experience of the American continental currency, the paper money of the French Revolution and the British restriction period—had learned what a government can do to a nation’s currency system… Thus the sound-money principle has two aspects. It is affirmative in approving the market’s choice of a commonly used medium of exchange. It is negative in obstructing the government’s propensity to meddle with the currency system.
   

Money and Credit  
"Sound money meant a metallic standard. Standard coins should be in fact a definite quantity of the standard metal as precisely determined by the law of the country. Only standard coins should have unlimited legal-tender quality. Token coins and all kinds of moneylike paper should be, on presentation and without delay, redeemed in lawful standard money…  
The defeat of those favoring silver and the unfeasibility of bimetallism eventually made the sound-money principle mean the gold standard. At the end of the nineteenth century there was all over the world unanimity among businessmen and statesmen with regard to the indispensability of the gold standard. Countries which were under a fiat-money system or under the silver standard considered adoption of the gold standard the foremost goal of their economic policy. Those who disputed the eminence of the gold standard were dismissed as cranks by the representatives of the official doctrine — professors, bankers, statesmen, editors of the great newspapers and magazines.  
It was a serious blunder of the supporters of sound money to adopt such tactics. There is no use in dealing in a summary way with any ideology however foolish and contradictory it may appear. Even a manifestly erroneous doctrine should be refuted by careful analysis and the unmasking of the fallacies implied. A sound doctrine can win only by exploding the delusions of its adversaries."
 
The excellence of the gold standard is to be seen in the fact that it renders the determination of the monetary unit's purchasing power independent of the policies of governments and political parties. Furthermore, it prevents rulers from eluding the financial and budgetary prerogatives of the representative assemblies. Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money. Viewed in this light, the gold standard appears as an indispensable implement of the body of constitutional guarantees that make the system of representative government function.

There is no social benefit from preventing price deflation
 
UCLA economist Andrew Atkinson, and Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank economist Patrick Kehoe, in a 2004 _American Economic Review_ article, have shown that there is no correlation between deflation and depression.==10== Looking at the evidence across 17 countries over more than 100 years, they concluded, “A broad historical look finds more periods of deflation with reasonable growth than with depression, and many more periods of depression with inflation than with deflation. Overall, the data show virtually no link between deflation and depression.”==11== Even for the Great Depression, they find that while all 16 countries for which there were data experienced deflation only 8 of them had a depression. And the relationship between deflation and depression was not statistically significant. For all other periods, beginning in 1820 for some countries, 65 of 73 deflation episodes had no depression and 21 of 29 depressions had no deflation. They wrote, “In a broader historical context, beyond the Great Depression, the notion that deflation and depression are linked virtually disappears.”==12== When all periods are put together, they found that “a 1-percentage-point drop in inflation is associated with a drop in the average real growth rate of just 0.08 of a percentage point, say, from 3.08 to 3.00.”==13== Finally, when they break the data into Pre-WW II and Post-WW II, they find a stronger correlation between deflation and depression for the early period, but a correlation between inflation and depression in the later period.

The monetary inflation and credit expansion of our elastic currency system would be eliminated and with it the booms and busts that have plagued our history.
