        <p>
          Bitcoin is one of the most amazing technological revolutions of our generation. Far too few understand its significance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like you, I ignored bitcoin for a very long time. I thought it was an investment or some kind of money&hellip;but bitcoin isn't what it appears at first glance.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, Bitcoin is, <em>by far,</em> the most interesting thing I've ever learned about in my entire life.
        </p>

        <p>
          And trust me &mdash; I've spent over a decade on the internet learning random things on the daily. Scouring obscure subreddits and diving deep into YouTube holes&hellip;and yet&hellip;nothing comes anywhere close to the beautiful complexity of bitcoin.
        </p>

        <p>
          My entire purpose in this world is to be a bitcoin educator and consultant. I've firmly decided that I'm dedicating the rest of my life to this internet money project, and to help others achieve financial sovereignty.
        </p>

        <p>
          My decision to focus my life on this project took years of research and internal debate, and I don't take this lightly.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to inspire others to be curious about this extremely disruptive and revolutionary technology. Only if my inspiration causes you to learn more about bitcoin, will you understand why I'm doing this.
        </p>

        <p>
          But&hellip;if you don't believe me, or don't get it yet, that's ok! Trust me, I didn't believe bitcoiners for a very long time either.
        </p>

        <p>
          It might take 5-10 years of ignoring it and multiple exposures before you realize.
        </p>

        <p>
          All I want is for you to remember me as the bitcoin guy and to come to me with questions when you need bitcoin for yourself and your family.
        </p>

        <h2>Ok so, the thing you should know about bitcoin is that it's not about making money.</h2>

        <p>It's not about getting rich, and it's not about the price.</p>

        <p>It's about freedom. It's about monetary revolution. It's about global economic disruption.</p>

        <p>Will fiat debasement and bitcoin adoption lead to increased purchasing power? Maybe.</p>

        <p>What I want to get across is that bitcoin is a tool of self sovereignty and a check on tyrannical power.</p>

        <p>If you're only here for the gains you should probably leave and invest in something you understand.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency for a reason.</h2>

        <p>It's the largest and most secure supercomputer on earth. It's the most secure and the most decentralized protocol in existence.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is the result of a fundamental breakthrough in computer science and cryptographic systems, eliminating the need for trusting in third parties like banks, corporations, and governments.</p>

        <p>This is trust in math, trust in code, not in humans.</p>

        <p>I knew about bitcoin for a very long time, but in hindsight&hellip;I didn't know anything.</p>

        <p>Knowing about bitcoin, and realizing what bitcoin is, are two <em>completely</em> different things!</p>

        <p>In bitcoin circles we call this phenomena falling down the rabbit hole. It's the process of slowly realizing what bitcoin is and then spending months and months and hundreds of hours obsessively learning as much as you can. My job is to make your fall down the rabbit hole as easy as possible.</p>

        <p>If you're curious.</p>

        <p>CEO's, politicians, millionaires, billionaires, presidents, academics, economists, computer scientists, engineers, athletes, media personal, and money nerds alike have all fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole, and their stories are much like mine.</p>

        <p>Once you learn what bitcoin is, I guarantee you that you'll be completely obsessed. There's no going back.</p>

        <h2>It took me 9 years of knowing about bitcoin, studying it, and dismissing it, before I realized.</h2>

        <p>Once I learned what bitcoin ACTUALLY was &ndash; once I fell down the rabbit hole &ndash; I too became obsessed, and would spend 4-8 hours a day every day, for over a year learning as much as I could.</p>

        <p>I realized that bitcoin is unique, that there is nothing else like it in the history of the world.</p>

        <p>And I'll say that after all of my research, after hundreds of hours trying to find the catch, I've realized that bitcoin is completely inevitable and one of the most important projects going on right now in the world.</p>

        <p>I've never been so sure about something in my entire life.</p>

        <p>I've since decided I am going to dedicate the rest of my life to the digital money project. The most ethical, transparent, unbiased, and peaceful money in history.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin solves some of the most important problems plaguing humanity.</h2>

        <p>I like to call it the Manhattan project for human freedom in the digital age.</p>

        <p>It's an enormous, globally coordinated, research and development initiative. An open source software project aimed at building an unstoppable internet-native monetary system.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is more than just the best money ever made &ndash; it's a programmable, permissionless and indestructible software network. A tech stack which implements fair, neutral money and protects human rights for 8 billion people.</p>

        <p>Fighting back against authoritarianism and the encroachment of a digital Orwellian surveillance state.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is independent 21st century economic infrastructure existing outside of the global financial system. A monetary nuclear weapon if you will, bent on destroying fiat capitalism.</p>

        <p>There's a lot more to bitcoin then you might realize.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is the most important invention in economics and technology since the internet itself, it is the <em>internet of money</em> and it will do to money what the internet did to information.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is a trust machine and is obsoleting trusted human institutions, fundamentally altering existing power structures, it's a revolutionary invention that has changed the course of human history.</p>

        <Divider />

        <h2>Bitcoin is a global grassroots effort to build an escape hatch from government fiat currencies.</h2>

        <p>The whole point of Bitcoin is to remove humans from the issuance and control of money. And the corruption that comes with it.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin is the separation of money and state.</p>

        <p>Imagine the most powerful tool of civilization, pried from the clutches of the elite.</p>

        <p>I'm mostly spreading the word because I think bitcoin is fucking crazy, I'm not saying you should buy any.</p>

        <p>I'm here to warn you.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin can't be stopped, it's a money that's out of control.</p>

        <p>It is by far the most secure computational network in the world, and (due to its game theoretic financially incentivized feedback loops) it will only imbed itself further and further into society.</p>

        <p>If you don't learn anything else about bitcoin for the rest of your life, just remember this:</p>

        <h2>No one controls bitcoin, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.</h2>

        <p>And <strong>if</strong> it can't be stopped, shit's gonna get wild&hellip;.</p>
