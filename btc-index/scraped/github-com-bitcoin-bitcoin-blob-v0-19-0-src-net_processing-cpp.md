     * Tx download algorithm:
     *
     *   When inv comes in, queue up (process_time, txid) inside the peer's
     *   CNodeState (m_tx_process_time) as long as m_tx_announced for the peer
     *   isn't too big (MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS).
     *
     *   The process_time for a transaction is set to nNow for outbound peers,
     *   nNow + 2 seconds for inbound peers. This is the time at which we'll
     *   consider trying to request the transaction from the peer in
     *   SendMessages(). The delay for inbound peers is to allow outbound peers
     *   a chance to announce before we request from inbound peers, to prevent
     *   an adversary from using inbound connections to blind us to a
     *   transaction (InvBlock).
     *
     *   When we call SendMessages() for a given peer,
     *   we will loop over the transactions in m_tx_process_time, looking
     *   at the transactions whose process_time <= nNow. We'll request each
     *   such transaction that we don't have already and that hasn't been
     *   requested from another peer recently, up until we hit the
     *   MAX_PEER_TX_IN_FLIGHT limit for the peer. Then we'll update
     *   g_already_asked_for for each requested txid, storing the time of the
     *   GETDATA request. We use g_already_asked_for to coordinate transaction
     *   requests amongst our peers.
     *
     *   For transactions that we still need but we have already recently
     *   requested from some other peer, we'll reinsert (process_time, txid)
     *   back into the peer's m_tx_process_time at the point in the future at
     *   which the most recent GETDATA request would time out (ie
     *   GETDATA_TX_INTERVAL + the request time stored in g_already_asked_for).
     *   We add an additional delay for inbound peers, again to prefer
     *   attempting download from outbound peers first.
     *   We also add an extra small random delay up to 2 seconds
     *   to avoid biasing some peers over others. (e.g., due to fixed ordering
     *   of peer processing in ThreadMessageHandler).
     *
     *   When we receive a transaction from a peer, we remove the txid from the
     *   peer's m_tx_in_flight set and from their recently announced set
     *   (m_tx_announced).  We also clear g_already_asked_for for that entry, so
     *   that if somehow the transaction is not accepted but also not added to
     *   the reject filter, then we will eventually redownload from other
     *   peers.
